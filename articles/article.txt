The Vhembe District Municipality (VDM), in partnership with Limpopo Economic Development, Environment, and Tourism (LEDET) and the University of Venda (Univen), held a Wetland Day at Tshiheni village on Tuesday, 27 February, during which the names of the winners in the Lake Fundudzi Wetland Schools Competition were announced.
Ms Muofhe Masutha, an officer from LEDET, provided an overview of the competition to learners from schools in and around Tshiheni village, stating that learners had been advised to create posters and prepare presentations on the importance of wetlands, focusing on Lake Fundudzi. They had also been educated on the importance of refraining from cutting down trees around Lake Fundudzi and near the wetlands, said Masutha.
The winner of the senior phase category of the competition was Khakhu Secondary School. Their teacher, Mr Ailwei Mathabi, was elated when hearing that they were the overall winners of the competition. “We were tasked with examining the importance of protecting the wetlands and the interventions that we, as people living around wetlands, can implement. It was an exciting presentation for our learners. We are also delighted that, in addition to being one of the winners, we won a trip. We can choose to go with learners to either Mapungubwe Heritage Site or Kruger National Park,” said Mathabi.
The executive mayor of the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM), Cllr Freda Nkondo, stressed the importance of protecting the wetlands. “I call upon traditional leaders to take the lead in educating and changing the mindset of our communities regarding the protection of our wetlands," she said.
Khosi VhoThandululo Tshivhase said that wetlands were critical components of the ecosystem. He urged people to work together to protect the wetlands.
Twelve schools from in and around Tshiheni participated in the Lake Fundudzi Wetland Schools Competition, and the following schools secured first place: Tshidzivhe Primary School (foundation phase), Tshidzivhe Primary School (intermediate phase), and Khakhu Secondary School (senior phase).

Tears of joy flowed when a 16-year-old girl who had disappeared without a trace in July last year was reunited with her family at Mulodi village last Thursday. This came after the story of the disappearance of Tshavhungwa Mmbengwa was reported in theLimpopo Mirror.
Speaking to the newspaper at her house in Mulodi village on Saturday afternoon, Ms Rendani Mushaphi said she had received telephone calls from some of the newspaper’s readers, saying they had seen her daughter in the Thohoyandou area. “I could not believe it at first, but after the third call, I rushed to town and found my beloved daughter walking alone next to one of the big grocery shops. It looks like there was someone who knows me who was with her,” she said.
She mentioned that she had been searching for her daughter everywhere for the past six months without success, but for the media to help her family trace their beloved daughter had taken less than a day. Ms Mushaphi said she had immediately phoned the police to inform them that her daughter had been found alive. When asked where she had been for the past six months, the shy-looking and frightened Tshavhungwa Mmbengwa said she had been taken by unknown people, together with four other girls from Vuwani, to Pretoria, where they had been taken to a secret house.
Ms Mushaphi said that her daughter was still very traumatised and did not want to talk about the incident. “I am only happy that my daughter is back home and safe,” she said.

The rural village of Bungeni's heritage site was alive with Tshivenda and Xitsonga traditional dances, such astshigombelaandxigubu, along with the drinking of marula beer on Friday, 8 March. This event was hosted and celebrated by the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM), in conjunction with the Department of Sport, Arts, and Culture, marking the 2024 Vhembe DistrictKu Luma Vukanyi /U thetshela mukumbi/ Tasting of the marula beer (The Festival of the First Fruit).
The marula season typically spans between January and March each year. During this time, the drinking of beer brings communities together, fostering social cohesion as people enjoy the beverage in a communal and celebratory manner.
The economic value of marula fruits has been extensively researched, and the marula industry is thriving nationwide. It serves as a significant source of job creation and income generation, particularly for rural, unemployed women who collect the fruits and start brewing beer.
Mr Thagalu Thovhakale, the Department of Sport, Arts, and Culture’s Vhembe District director, highlighted that his department, in collaboration with Vhembe District Municipality (VDM), had purchased more than 1,500 litres of marula beer from rural women in the region. This beer was then freely distributed during the festival.
Renowned traditional healer Dr Mashudu Dima, who was invited to the event, conducted rituals before the consumption of the marula beer. He emphasised the importance of traditional leaders, such as Hosi Given Bungeni, chairperson of Vhembe House of Traditional Leaders, the executive mayor of VDM, Freda Nkondo, and member of the legislature, Philemon Mdaka, being the first to taste the marula beer as they are custodians of tradition and culture.
Dr Dima explained that marula beer undergoes several stages, includingnashane, which is 5% sweet,lutanda, typically consumed by young and adult individuals, andtshamunandi, favoured by elderly and married individuals because of its rich ingredients.
Executive Mayor Freda Nkondo expressed the district's commitment to supporting heritage events such as the marula festival to uphold tradition. "Observing people along the roads of the Vhembe District with bottles of marula beer highlights the quick cash our rural population can generate through its sale. I urge our economic development and planning section to continue exploring the potential of establishing a fully operational marula factory in our municipality as we host and commemorate an annual festival with long-term economic benefits for our communities," Nkondo remarked.

Tsianda man dies after being attacked with angle grinder

Last Sunday (10th), the community of Tsianda woke up to the sad news of the gruesome killing of a local man. The deceased, Mr Takalani Magodi (42), met his brutal end after being attacked by an assailant who used an angle grinder to cut and kill him.
From the information available, Magodi was apparently on his way home from the local liquor store when he had an altercation with three men, whereupon one of them took an angle grinder and cut him several times. He was declared dead at the scene.
The shocking incident, which has become the talk of the village, happened at the Tsianda Mafhali T-junction at around 22:30. According to Vhembe police spokesperson Warrant Officer Vuledzani Dathi, they were alerted and went to the scene of the crime. Upon arrival, the police found the body of a man lying in a pool of blood.
“It is alleged that a grinder was used to cut him, whereupon he bled to death. The motive for the killing is not clear at this stage. A charge of murder has been opened, and a 35-year-old suspect has been arrested,” he said.
Community member Mr Emmanuel Muofhe, who is also the chairperson of Blackstone Stokvel - of which the late Magodi was a member - said they had all had a good time at a Levubu resort shortly before the incident. He said they were still in a state of denial that he was no more.
“This came as a shock. Magodi was a good man who was always smiling. He had big plans for his family, and he left a big, unfinished house. The very same Saturday we were laughing and joking about the Chiefs and Pirates game, as he was a big fan of the Chiefs. We were shocked to learn about his death the following day. This is a very sad incident, because even the suspect is known to me. He is a very good person whom you cannot expect to do such a heinous crime, but he realised he made a very grave mistake and asked to be handed over to the police, which we did,” he said.
Muofhe added that they had visited the bereaved family as a stokvel to offer their condolences. “We are deeply hurt, and we will monitor this case until the end. We will only find closure after the killer explains what caused him to commit such a crime,” Muofhe said.
A suspect, Mr Edzisani Mamphogoro (35), appeared in the Vuwani Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday 12 March and was charged with murder. His case was postponed to 30 April for further investigations, and he remains in custody.

Bullies must stop 'barbaric actions' says pastor at learner's funeral

A 16-year-old student from Silemale Secondary School, Zwidofhela Netshiungani, who had allegedly committed suicide on Tuesday, 27 February after reportedly being bullied by other students at school, was laid to rest at the Khubvi Cemetery on Sunday morning.
Addressing more than 3,000 mourners who braved a very chilly morning to support the bereaved Netshiungani family, Pastor Billy Mudau lashed out at learners who bully others at school, branding them as enemies of progress, and warned them to cease such barbaric actions.
“Your parents send you to school to learn and acquire an education for a bright future, not to bully others,” he stated. He added that their church is located just behind the Silemale School premises, and they frequently observe boys and girls sneaking out of the school premises during school hours and disappearing into nearby bushes. “You are not there to start families. Concentrate on what your parents have sent you to school to do,” he urged.
The chairperson of the Khubvi Civic Association, Mr Tsumbedzo Ratshilumela, called on parents to support the education of their children. “One of the problems affecting learners at Silemale Secondary School is that parents are not supporting teachers and the Department of Education in addressing issues affecting their children at the school,” he lamented. A visibly angry Mr Ratshilumela expressed his frustration that when parents are invited to attend meetings at the school, they often do not attend.
“As we speak, there is no school-governing body (SGB) at Silemale Secondary School. We hear bullying is rampant at the school, and there is nothing that teachers can do. As parents, how do you feel when we end up burying kids who commit suicide because of your children’s actions?” he questioned.
He highlighted that the learners’ academic performance at the school is subpar because instead of focusing on their education, they are preoccupied with bullying others. “It ranked last in the matric results last year. This school is embarrassing us as residents of Khubvi village. One death is too many, and this must stop now,” he declared.

Gardener may have saved boss's life, court hears

When the Radzuma brothers’ murder case resumed in the Limpopo High Court in Thohoyandou on Monday, the court heard how a gardener might have saved the life of one of the officials of the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM).
Simon, Percy, and Ndivhuwo Radzuma stand accused of the murder of SAMWU officials Timpson Musetsho and Roni Mani in 2019. They also face numerous counts of robbery.
During Monday’s hearing, Tafadza Mpofu, a Zimbabwean national, told the court that he had been hard at work in his boss’s garden in Itsani village on 4 February 2019 when people had suddenly arrived.
Mpofu was working for Nnditsheni Magidi, an employee of the VDM and an active member of the South African Municipal Workers Union (SAMWU). Magidi was one of the people who had gone into hiding after hearing that he was being targeted by criminals. This was allegedly because he and others were too vocal about the VDM’s unlawful investment of R300 million in the now-defunct VBS.
Mpofu told the court that he did not trust the visitors. “I became suspicious about the people [and thought] they might be criminals after they asked me about the room in which my boss slept. How could a visitor ask that? What did he want to do, to know my boss’s room?” said Mpofu.
The court was again packed to capacity with relatives, friends, and visitors. Mpofu testified that he had informed his boss of the visit as soon as the latter had arrived home that day. “I was also frightened by these people because they came to Magidi’s homestead two days in succession,” said Mpofu.
When Judge Thogomelani Tshidada asked Mpofu if he could show the court the person who had come to Magidi’s homestead that day, Mpofu went straight to the accused dock and pointed at Simon Radzuma.
During cross-questioning, the legal representative of Simon Radzuma, Advocate Gundo Lidovho, asked Mpofu how he could recognise a person who had visited his boss’s home seven years ago. Mpofu said the suspect, Simon, had not covered his face when he had come and asked about the whereabouts of his boss, and he recognised him because of his big and sharp nose.

One of South Africa's most educated sons, who was an engineer, an inventor, and a professor, Mulalo Reuben Doyoyo, passed away at his house in Kyalami Estates, Johannesburg, last week.
His elder brother, Mr Tshitokisi Bitches Doyoyo, said earlier this week that the death had come as an unexpected shock to the family. He said that another brother, Mr Albert Doyoyo, had tried to phone Mulalo last Wednesday, but could not get hold of him. They then started contacting other family members to check up on him.
“After all of us failed to locate him telephonically, Albert decided to go and check on him at his house with his other sister, Tshifanyiso Doyoyo, and that was when they discovered that he was no more,” he said.
Born and bred in Vondwe village, Mulalo started his education at Vondwe Lower Primary School in 1977 and then moved on to Tshidimbini Higher Primary School in 1981. He joined Tshidimbini Secondary School in 1984, where he studied until 1985. In 1986, he registered at Mbilwi Secondary School. He was later elected as the head boy of the school, matriculating in 1988.
While studying at the University of the Western Cape, he became a publication officer of the Student Engineering Council, a student representative of the South African Institute of Aerospace Engineers, and a founder of the Student Aerospace Society in the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment.
He completed a master’s degree in solid mechanics and applied mathematics in 1995 and 1996, respectively. In 1999, he accepted a postdoctoral research position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to enhance his studies in applied mechanics.
He also worked as a lecturer at the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), where he created the Ultralight Systems Laboratory dedicated to experimental research on ultralight materials.
He will be buried at Vondwe Cemetery on Sunday. The funeral service will be held at home, starting at 06:00.

A 51-year-old murder suspect, Shumani Godfrey Muleya, who was arrested for allegedly killing his girlfriend last week, appeared in the Mutale Magistrate's Court on Monday. Muleya is accused of hacking Mpho Grace Thiba (40) to death at her house in Muswodi Tshisimani village early last Friday morning.
At the time of her death Thiba, a mother of six, worked as part of the nutrition staff at Ratshibvumo High School.
Muleya appeared to be calm and collected when he appeared in court and he told the magistrate that he would like to get a Legal Aid lawyer. Magistrate Theodora Mathivha postponed the case to 27 March for further police investigations.
According to the SAPS’s acting communications manager in the Vhembe District, WO Vuledzani Dathi, the police were busy performing duties in the early hours on Friday morning when they were telephonically alerted about an incident where a female victim was allegedly killed by her boyfriend at her own house.
“According to the information we received, the couple were asleep when the cellphone of the deceased rang, and she answered it. After the call, her boyfriend allegedly started to accuse her of having an affair and a heated argument ensued between them. That's when the suspect allegedly took a panga [knife] and chopped her all over her body and she died instantly,” Dathi said.
Dathi added that after the attack, the suspect went to a separate room where two children aged five and eight were sleeping and told them that he had killed their mother before disappearing into the darkness.

Masindi case likely to introduce new era of customary law

The court battle currently playing out to determine who should be the king or queen of the VhaVenda may very well introduce a new era of customary law in South Africa. At the heart of the case are issues such as whether only male contenders are allowed to rule and whether known fraudsters should be contenders for the highest title. It also addresses the issue of whether the courts should assist in developing customary law in cases where the various kingdoms neglect to do so to bring it in line with the country’s constitution.
An application to amend a notice of motion was served before Judge President Moletje George Phatudi in the Limpopo High Court last week. The amended notice of motion asks the court to provide clarity on several issues before the main case to determine the VhaVenda leader commences.
Background
The “Masindi case” has already entered its 12thyear, dating back to December 2012 when the then-21-year-old Masindi Clementine Mphephu filed papers in the Limpopo High Court, some three months after former President Jacob Zuma had published a notice in theGovernment Gazettethat recognised Toni Mphephu-Ramabulana as king of the Venda nation. Masindi claimed that she was the rightful heir to the throne but was overlooked because of her gender.
The case lingered for almost four years before the first ruling was made. The parties asked the court to provide clarity on some technical issues, orpoints in limine. These included matters of jurisdiction, the periods of prescription, and the applicable review processes to be followed.
In December 2016, Judge President Ephraim Makgoba dismissed Masindi’s case. He was not convinced that the applicants had exhausted all other avenues, such as the Commission on Traditional Leadership Disputes and Claims, to resolve the dispute. He was also not convinced that the issue of male primogeniture was central to the case. Judge Makgoba later also refused them permission to appeal his verdict.
While this was happening, Masindi’s legal team managed to obtain an interdict to stop the inauguration of Toni Mphephu as king. They later successfully applied for permission to appeal directly to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA).
On Friday, 12 April 2019, the SCA announced its judgment, which came as a severe blow to the Mphephu-Ramabulana royal family. The five Supreme Court judges agreed with the High Court on some of its findings but disagreed on most of the important issues raised. They also disagreed with Judge Makgoba’s stance that the courts should not give direction in such matters. “The courts are vested with authority to adjudicate customary law issues in appropriate cases and to that end Section 211 of the Constitution obliges them to apply and give effect to customary law where it is implicated,” the judgment reads.
The SCA ruled that the process to appoint a new leader must start afresh. The case was referred back to the Limpopo High Court for a new hearing, but this time in front of another judge. The SCA emphasised that the royal family has an obligation to reform traditional practices such as those that promote gender discrimination. The House of Traditional Leaders was also ordered to provide input to the court.
After waiting for more than a year, the legal team of the Mphephu-Ramabulana royal family filed papers with the Constitutional Court, asking that the SCA’s decision be set aside. Masindi Mphephu’s legal team also filed a counter-application, asking that the stay order of the SCA (which meant that Toni continued as an interim ruler) be set aside and that she be awarded costs in the various cases.
The royal family’s application was dismissed, but Masindi’s was entertained by the Constitutional Court, which ruled that hearing her case was in the interest of justice. On Friday, 12 November 2021, Judge Sisi Khampepe delivered the judgment - a unanimous decision supported by her seven fellow judges.
The SCA's order to allow Toni Mphephu-Ramabulana to keep reigning was summarily set aside. “It could be years before the review proceedings are finally settled … It also means that Mr Mphephu-Ramabulana will continue to unlawfully occupy the throne in circumstances where his appointment has been found to have been unconstitutional and invalid,” the judges ruled. A cost order was also awarded in Masindi’s favour for all the cases up to that point.
The war starts afresh – with some new battles
The extremely slow pace of the legal system is very evident in the Masindi case. A pre-trial conference was held early in February 2022, but what became clear was that the royal family would raise numerous technical objections. This was followed by a series of more pre-trial conferences, where issues such as the VBS matter and the necessity to develop customary law were debated.
The first hurdle Masindi’s legal team must clear now is to get the court’s approval to amend their notice of motion. They argue that this was necessitated because of events happening after the original papers had been filed, such as the SCA ruling and the ruling in the Constitutional Court. They also argue that the VBS saga, where Toni Mphephu has been implicated in the fraud, emphasised the need to bring in a “corruption amendment”.
The request to amend the notice of motion was only opposed by the eighth respondent, the Mphephu-Ramabulana royal family council. The other respondents, which include the SA President, the Limpopo Premier, and the national and provincial houses of traditional leaders, opted not to oppose the amendments.
In the amended notice of motion, Masindi’s legal team requests that all the affidavits filed by the parties in the SCA and the Constitutional Court form part of the record of evidence. This is likely a move aimed at also introducing evidence of perjury, where they believe senior members of the royal family had lied under oath to protect Toni Ramabulana.
One of the amendments that is sure to cause a lot of discussion, should it be allowed, is the “corruption amendment”. Masindi’s legal team asks the court to make a declaration that no person associated with corruption may succeed to the position of king or queen of the VhaVenda. “This amendment is essential because, since the hearing in the High Court, there has been an avalanche of evidence to demonstrate that the first respondent is associated with corruption pertaining to the VBS Bank,” the application reads.
The amendments dwell at length on the need for an “anti-corruption” clause. “The fact that they [traditional leaders] are not subject to elections, and hold positions for life, means that they are all the more compelled to be scrupulously incorruptible and honest. It is therefore essential that in these proceedings that will determine who will end up as life-long king or queen of the VhaVenda, this issue is aired and scrutinised,” the amendment states.
The Dzekiso wife conundrum
An argument previously raised by the royal family is that Masindi was not born from a “dzekiso” or candle wife. In cases where a king has several wives, a rule is often applied that the successor may only come from the children of the specially selected wife. The argument is that VhaVenda custom prohibits the successor to the crown from being the child of amusiwana(commoner), which also means that neither Masindi nor Toni would qualify.
In the amendments, the problems that such an arbitrary selection mechanism holds are highlighted. Masindi is the only child of the late ruler, Dimbanyika, which means that no need for such a selection mechanism exists, they argue. The court is asked to declare that VhaVenda customary law makes provision for this, or needs to be developed to make provision that an only child be considered as being from the Dzekiso wife.
A further amendment addresses the issue raised that Masindi was born before her father became king. The royal family has argued that only children born after a king was inaugurated may be in line to succeed him. Masindi disputes that any such rule exists, and she is supported in this regard by the national and provincial houses. “However, if contrary to the applicant's contentions it were to be established that there is such a rule, then the only logic would be to act as a selection mechanism between pre- and post-accession children competing for the throne. Here the applicant is the only contender, which illustrates the futility of the application of the rule in the present circumstances,” Masindi’s legal team argues.
Still a long way to go
Masindi’s attorney, Mr Johann Hammann, was very optimistic that they would succeed in their application to have the amendments approved by the court. Judge Phatudi is expected to make a ruling before the end of February. However, this does not mean that the case will be heard within the next few months. Hammann said that they were pushing to set a date for a hearing, but the other parties were not very cooperative.
The issue of an interim leader is also still far from being settled. In July last year, the Mphephu-Ramabulana royal council asked the Constitutional Court to make a ruling regarding the appointment of an interim leader. The Limpopo High Court previously ruled that an interim leader could not be appointed while a review application was pending.
The royal family wants to appoint Mavhungu David Mphephu (commonly known as Japan Mphephu) as acting king, but this is opposed by the Limpopo Premier and the MEC, as well as by Masindi. In Masindi’s case, one of their arguments is that Japan Mphephu is not a proper candidate because he allegedly lied under oath in his affidavits.
The case is expected to be heard before the Constitutional Court on Thursday (29 February).

A 36-year-old female security guard from Tshino Ndiitwani outside Vuwani was shot and killed on her way back from work on Friday, 16 February, at around 21:00. The incident happened at a soccer field, approximately 100 metres away from her house.
Local residents apparently heard the sound of a gunshot and screaming, prompting them to gather at the scene. A resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said they were shocked to find her dead while wearing her uniform. “A bakkie fled the scene after she was shot. The killings happening in our community are very concerning, and most of them occur during load shedding,” said the witness.
She was later identified as Ivy Khumbelo Sigidi. She leaves behind two children, a boy (10) and a girl (13).
The police at Vuwani have launched a manhunt for the suspect(s) following the shooting. The SAPS’s spokesperson in Limpopo, Lt-Col Malesela Ledwaba, said a preliminary investigation had revealed that the deceased was coming from work at a local retail store when she was shot and killed by an unknown suspect(s). “The police opened a case of murder. The motive behind the incident is currently unknown but will be determined by further investigation. The police investigation is still ongoing,” said Ledwaba.
Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the suspects involved should contact Detective Sergeant Dovhani Sadiki on 083 872 5529, the crime stop number on 08600 10111, the nearest police station, or theMySAPSapp.

The mafia-type war raging among Vhembe’s gangs seems far from over. In the latest incident, a man was gunned down in broad daylight next to a well-known food outlet in Sibasa.
According to one of the people who were in the vicinity on Tuesday morning (20th) when the incident occurred, the suspected gunmen parked their car next to a well-known garage, opposite a car wash. They crossed the road towards the car wash, and within minutes, the sound of gunshots rang out. “It was around 13:00, and we all had to dive for cover when the guns started roaring. I will never go near that area again in my life,” he said.
According to the acting communications manager of the SAPS in the Vhembe District, W/O Vuledzani Dathi, the Thohoyandou Police received a report stating that a shooting incident had taken place at Sibasa Badugela Car Wash. He said that, upon their arrival at the crime scene, the police officers had found the body of a male person lying on the ground.
“He was certified dead by EMS personnel at the scene. The deceased’s vehicle was still parked at the car wash. Preliminary investigations reveal that the deceased was shot by four armed men who were driving a white Toyota Etios. Nothing was taken from the deceased, and several empty cartridges were found at the crime scene,” Dathi said. The deceased was identified as Mpho Thabela.
Dathi added that the deceased had been in the company of a male friend, who had also been shot at by the suspects but seemingly managed to escape. The suspects are currently unknown, and police investigations are ongoing.
Thabela is the eighth victim to be killed since the alleged gang killings started in the Vhembe District last year.

Post-mortem must say if man's death was murder or suicide?

The family of a 31-year-old soccer star, Morricheal Mudau, said they were left with many unanswered questions after the body of their son was found in the bushes in Vondwe village. Mudau was found not far from his home village, Mbahe Tshilatshe, where he stayed with his mother.
According to the deceased’s brother-in-law, Mr Nnditsheni Matsheketsheke, Mudau went missing on Monday, 12 February and was found three weeks later, on Wednesday, 28 February.
“When he left home on Monday, nobody saw him because his mother was at the hospital for check-ups. He did not tell anyone where he was going. We were surprised when he didn't come home. He always slept at home. That was when we suspected something was wrong. We went into his room, and we found his phone without a sim card.” Matsheketsheke said they reported him as missing, and the community started to search for him.
“We searched the forests of Mbahe, Mukula, and Vondwe, with no luck. After a few weeks, I received a call from home telling me that two cow herders had found a body in the Vondwe forest. As a family, we are confused because we searched in that forest, and we did not find him. We are now waiting for a post-mortem that will tell us if he was murdered or if he had committed suicide,” said Matsheketsheke.
When Mudau was found, the body was already badly decomposed. “We are not sure if his face was burned or decomposed, but it was beyond recognition, and police asked us to first perform a DNA test before we could bury him. We received the results on Monday, 11 March, and we are busy arranging for a funeral that will take place on Thursday, 14 March,” he said.
Matsheketsheke said he would want people to remember his brother-in-law as someone who had loved playing soccer and making music.
Vhembe police spokesperson W/O Vuledzani Dathi, said the family had received the deceased’s body on Monday after DNA results had come back positive.
“An inquest case docket has been registered at Thohoyandou SAPS, pending the post-mortem results. Anyone who can assist the police with any information regarding the case can contact the investigating officer, Sergeant Makhuvha, at 082 469 1397,” Dathi added.

One of South Africa's most educated sons, who was an engineer, an inventor, and a professor, Mulalo Reuben Doyoyo, passed away at his house in Kyalami Estates, Johannesburg, last week.
His elder brother, Mr Tshitokisi Bitches Doyoyo, said earlier this week that the death had come as an unexpected shock to the family. He said that another brother, Mr Albert Doyoyo, had tried to phone Mulalo last Wednesday, but could not get hold of him. They then started contacting other family members to check up on him.
“After all of us failed to locate him telephonically, Albert decided to go and check on him at his house with his other sister, Tshifanyiso Doyoyo, and that was when they discovered that he was no more,” he said.
Born and bred in Vondwe village, Mulalo started his education at Vondwe Lower Primary School in 1977 and then moved on to Tshidimbini Higher Primary School in 1981. He joined Tshidimbini Secondary School in 1984, where he studied until 1985. In 1986, he registered at Mbilwi Secondary School. He was later elected as the head boy of the school, matriculating in 1988.
While studying at the University of the Western Cape, he became a publication officer of the Student Engineering Council, a student representative of the South African Institute of Aerospace Engineers, and a founder of the Student Aerospace Society in the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment.
He completed a master’s degree in solid mechanics and applied mathematics in 1995 and 1996, respectively. In 1999, he accepted a postdoctoral research position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to enhance his studies in applied mechanics.
He also worked as a lecturer at the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), where he created the Ultralight Systems Laboratory dedicated to experimental research on ultralight materials.
He will be buried at Vondwe Cemetery on Sunday. The funeral service will be held at home, starting at 06:00.

Please bring my daughter home, pleads mother

The mother of a 16-year-old girl who disappeared without a trace in July last year says that, deep down in her heart, she believes that her teenage girl will come back home alive one day. Ms Rendani Mushaphi (38), a mother of three from Mulodi village in the Thengwe area, said in an interview that her daughter, Tshavhungwe Mmbengwa, had disappeared on 22 July last year shortly after she had returned from school.
“It was very cold on that day, and I was relaxing in my bedroom. She just told me where she put the change from the pocket money that I gave her in the morning, before she disappeared,” she said. She added that after searching for her without success later that day, she opened a case of a missing person at the Mutale Police Station.
“Until today, there is no sign of where my daughter is. I keep on dreaming about her coming back home to me,” she said. She added that in February she had received a call from a woman from Tshakhuma, saying that she had spotted a girl who looked like Tshavhungwe who was living with a dangerous criminal in that area.
“This was after I posted her pictures on social media. The woman told me to bring the police as the guy is a very dangerous criminal, but I went there alone on the very same day, but unfortunately, I found that she was not the one,” she said. Mushaphi is pleading with whoever has her daughter to bring her home. “Please, I beg you in the name of God, bring her home,” she said.
Speaking on a national radio station on Tuesday night, the spokesperson for Save the Children South Africa, Mr Konanani Mudau, said that the number of children who disappeared in the country was increasing every year. “It is very painful that 30% of those children are never found or found dead,” he said.
When asked what the main causes of the children’s disappearance were, he said three main reasons existed. Children are kidnapped to assist with drug peddling, they are used to claim a ransom, or they get used for human trafficking.

Vendors worried about losing their income

Street vendors who sell their wares and food near the Matidze Complex and the now-abandoned multi-million-rand model taxi rank in Thohoyandou are up in arms, accusing the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM) of not respecting their right tovukuzenzela(to get up and do things for themselves). The vendors are fed up with having to deal with a burst water pipe near the complex, which causes a stream of stream of water to spill past their stalls.
The problem has been continuing for about a year, the hawkers say. The water runs along Joyce Bongwe and Wilson Mufamadi Street, where they operate their stalls. They say that besides all this precious, clean water going to waste, they are losing business, as customers do not want to step into the pools of water, soiled by passing cars, to visit their stalls.
Limpopo Mirrorreported on this same burst water pipe in March last year. The vendors and nearby businesses claim that, despite reporting it to the VDM on numerous occasions, the problem persists.
Ms Lutendo Thoboni, who runs a food stall there, said they were battling with unemployment and thought it a good idea to start their own small businesses that could earn them an honest income. “Selling foods and cool drinks to customers in Thohoyandou was better than having to sell our bodies as sex workers. We wanted to create jobs for ourselves. Then the problem with the burst pipe started last year, which has now also caused damage to the roads. We are starting to lose customers because while they are eating our food, passing vehicles splash dirty water from the road over their food. No customers like to eat food in a dirty environment. Cooking under these difficult conditions, we end up penniless the whole day.”
Another street vendor, Ms Mbavhi Mathegu, added that clean water was always needed in the communities, and when clean water was just being wasted, they became worried.
The spokesperson for the Vhembe District Municipality, Mr Matodzi Ralushai, acknowledged that bursting water pipes could lead to shortages of water in Thohoyandou town. He said that a team from the technical services department was summoned to investigate and further repair the water pipe in the Matidze Complex in Thohoyandou.

Mr Nzumbululo Nekhumbe, an EMS driver from Mutale, emerged as the overall winner of the Limpopo Driver of the Year competition, held at Polokwane Airport on 2 March.
Nekhumbe, from Folovhodwe, is the driver of a light delivery vehicle (LDV) and has 16 years of experience driving EMS vehicles.
The drivers competed in several categories, including rigid trucks, articulated trucks, light delivery vans, rigid trucks with trailers, and male and female bus and taxi categories. Nekhumbe went home with a cash prize of R20,000, including R5,000 for being the overall winner, along with a trophy and certificate.
Moses Nemakhavhani of Hope Transport at Venetia Mine won the category for bus driver of the year and collected R15,000, along with a trophy and certificate. Mashudu Bebeda of Hope Transport in Venetia took the second position in the LDV category and received R10,000, a trophy, and certificates.
The MEC for Transport and Community Safety, Ms. Florence Radzilani, said the main objective of the competition was to revise the driving skills of drivers in the country as the competition also runs at a national level. “The competition involves drivers of big vehicles, like buses and trucks. This is where we test all the drivers participating in the competition, on public roads and also inside the testing ground. It’s like when a person is getting tested for a driver’s licence,” she said.
Radzilani acknowledged that they were pleased to see that the number of participants for this year’s competition had increased dramatically, especially as more women were also taking part. “This really shows that people are taking the competition very seriously. This will also assist in terms of reducing accidents on our roads, where a lot of lives will be saved through this programme,” outlined Radzilani.
The overall winner in the LDV category, Nekhumbe, said he knew he was going to do it “because I’m a confident driver who always follows the rules of the road. I do not doubt that I will represent Limpopo well during the national competitions later this year.”

Thengwe residents demand fair process when appointing security guards

Angry residents from Thengwe and surrounding communities in the Mutale area blocked the entrance to the newly built Thengwe clinic on Wednesday, 28 February. They raised various complaints, with the most significant concern being the recruitment process for new security guards.
The new state-of-the-art Thengwe clinic, constructed by the Limpopo Department of Health to replace the old and dilapidated clinic, is nearing completion and is expected to begin delivering services soon.
Mr Khodani Mudanalwo, a community leader in Thengwe, highlighted that the impoverished deep rural areas lack job opportunities. He expressed opposition to any entity preventing local residents from accessing job opportunities within their jurisdiction.
Mudanalwo pointed out that a security company, BJM Security Services, was recruiting guards for the new clinic without informing the local communities. He argued that community members, some of whom had received training from accredited security training colleges, should be given priority for these positions.
In response, Mr Joel Masingi, the managing director of BJM Security Services, explained that the company had initially sought assistance from the ward councillor and traditional leader for recruitment. However, they later realised the need for an open recruitment system.
Following a meeting with community leaders, the traditional leader, and the councillor on February 28, an agreement was reached. Suitable candidates interested in working as guards under BJM Security Services were requested to submit their CVs.
Masingi mentioned that the selection process for candidates was scheduled for March 16, during which candidates will be assessed based on their qualifications and experience.
