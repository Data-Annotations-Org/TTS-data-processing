Title: NEDBANK ESWATINI R4MILLION HOUSE ‘GRABBING’ SCANDAL:Law Society Disciplinary Tribunal dismisses Pado Construction Director Patrick Nxumalo’s complaint against lawyer Henwood.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
MBABANE:Musa Sibandze,the Acting Chairman of the Law Society of Eswatini(LSS) has dismissed a complaint filed by Pado Construction(Pty) Ltd Director Patrick Nxumalo against lawyer John Henwood.The Acting Chairman sitting with lawyers Nhlanhla Ginindza and Sinethemba Khumalo concluded that, Nxumalo’s complaint “has no merit” and therefore was dismissed ex-temporae.Lawyer Musa Sibandze took over and chaired the disciplinary proceedings after Law Society Chairman Zweli Jele recused himself as per Patrick Nxumalo’s application.Nxumalo reported his former lawyer John Henwood to the Law Society,accusing him of colluding with Nedbank Eswatini to attach and subsequently buy his R4million house.The once successful millionaire businessman alleged that,Henwood who was his lawyer,acted with a conflict of interest when purchasing the house.But the Law Society,in its ruling concluded that Nxumalo failed to prove the conflict of interest particularly because,Henwood was engaged by Nxumalo’s Pado Construction as a debt collector in 2010 and the process to purchase the house started in 2013, three(3)years after Henwood withdrew his services.“At the preliminary hearing, the Complainant did not dispute that Henwood withdrew from acting for him in 2010, so he could not explain why he felt that Henwood still had an Attorney-Client relationship with him some three(3) years later without giving him instructions since 2010. In so far as the Complainant asserts that as a result of Henwood’s erstwhile relationship with Pado Construction, he had come into prejudicial knowledge of the “company documents@ and “financial standing” at Pado Construction and ought not to have accepted Nedbank’s instructions against this company.I consider that  the previous instructions given to Henwood by Pado Construction were specific to claims by Pado Construction against SIDC and Zinhle Investments.It is difficult to comprehend why or how, even if Henwood had become aware of Pado’s financial standing and company documents in 2010, he could use such knowledge to prejudice the Complainant’s company in a claim against them in 2013. Accordingly, this head of complaint is dismissed”, reads the Law Society ruling in part,delivered on the 7th February 2024.On another note,Nxumalo accuses lawyer Henwood of colluding with senior Nedbank Eswatini officials including Managing Director(MD) Fikile Nkosi and Mbali Sibanyoni,the then Credit Manager now Eswatini Building Society(EBS) Managing Director(MD) of colluding with the lawyer to frustrate and collapse his business with an ultimate intention to ‘grab’ or buy his house.Nedbank Eswatini Managing Director(MD)Fikile Nkosi vigorously denied the allegations, while Mbali Sibanyoni referred comments to Nedbank. Documents in our possession suggest that,the matter was reported and subsequently investigated by the Central Bank and the Anti-Corruption Commission(ACC).

Title: PADO CONSTRUCTION DIRECTOR PATRICK NXUMALO:I became a street beggar,sleeping eMkhukwini in South Africa after Nedbank and lawyers destroyed my business and ‘grabbed’ my R4million house.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
MBABANE:Patrick Nxumalo,the once successful millionaire and Director of Pado Construction says,he literally became a street beggar after Nedbank Eswatini officials and a syndicate of legal practitioners linked to lawyer John Henwood allegedly colluded to destroy his business with an ultimate intention to ‘grab’ his R4million mansion in the capital city-Mbabane.As reported by this Swaziland News,Nxumalo whose business was generating an annual turnover of over R20million,was allegedly forced into poverty in what appeared to be a well-syndicated collusion between Nedbank officials that include Managing Director(MD) Fikile Nkosi,Mbali Sibanyoni,the then Credit Manager and a team of lawyers linked to Henwood.It is alleged that,Nedbank Eswatini was offering Nxumalo’s company an overdraft amounting to about R1.5million but,he subsequently received a call from the then Credit Manager Mbali Sibanyoni now Eswatini Building Society(EBS) Managing Director,informing him that the bank was withdrawing the facility without giving clear reasons for the withdrawal.This,according to Nxumalo,allegedly happened at a time when he was busy with his multimillion construction projects.The bank then seized full control of Nxumalo’s bank account and rushed to process documents attaching his R4million mansion.After destroying his business,Nedbank Eswatini quickly started the process of auctioning his house and Nxumalo’s lawyer John Henwood dumped him to represent Nedbank as a debt collector for the financial institution.Henwood who had privileged information about Nxumalo’s financial troubles,was then allegedly assisted by the bank to buy the R4million mansion at a lesser price.An investigation conducted by the Central Bank concluded that,there was an alleged conflict of interest and reffered the matter to the Anti-Corruption Commission(ACC), the investigation was conducted by Grant Thornton(former KPMG),a South African reputable company and a member of Grant Thornton International Ltd.Speaking to this Swaziland News on Saturday morning during an interview after this publication published the story on Friday evening, Nxumalo said he lost everything after being targeted by the alleged syndicate of lawyers and Nedbank officials.“After losing everything,I went to South Africa to stay with a relative because I was afraid to face members of the public who knew me as a successful businessman but unfortunately, the relative later died.I was then assisted by a Swazi woman who found me stranded on the streets at Kempton Park and I then went to reside eMkhukwini at Thembisa. I was using small containers to relief myself inside the Shack.My wife was forced out after Henwood purchased the house and she went to rent a stick and mud house in the outskirts of Mbabane. She ended-up seeking help from different people to accommodate our clothes in garages. Some of our clothes and furniture was destroyed by rain, I lost everything and I still can’t believe I’m still alive after all this”, said the once successful businessman when speaking to this publication.The double-storey house that was owned by Nxumalo and attracted the interest of lawyer Henwood and his syndicate within the legal fraternity,is situated at the prime area, on Portion one(1) of Lot 649 in the capital city-Mbabane next to the United Nation(UN) Eswatini Offices.Documents obtained by this Swaziland News investigation unit suggests that,Nxumalo,the Director of Pado Construction(Pty) Ltd was generating an over R20million annual turnover, and some of the company’s major projects include the construction of the R13million Matsapha Town Board Offices,the R8.5million Mbangweni National Housing flats as well as the R15.5million construction of schools across the country funded by the Japanese Government.Mbali Sibanyoni,the then Nedbank Eswatini Credit Manager now Eswatini Building Society(EBS) Managing Director(MD) reffered questions to Nedbank.Responding to this publication earlier,Nedbank Eswatini Managing Director Fikile Nkosi denied the allegations and threatened to take legal action against Nxumalo.“ Zwemart you know how I protect my integrity and office.If he wants to get personal then let’s deal with it in court-let’s meet there”, said the Nedbank Managing Director.Reached for comments,lawyer John Henwood told this publication that, he was rushing to a meeting hence he can’t talk.“Unfortunately,I’m rushing into a meeting hence I can’t speak”,said the lawyer.On another note,Central Bank SNG Grant Thornton report concluded that,the Central Bank as the regular of financial institutions, must consider reffering the matter to the Anti-Corruption Commission(ACC) for further investigation.“CBE should consider referring the matter to the Anti-Corruption Commission for further investigation in order to determine possible collusion between Nedbank officials and representatives of the bank’s sales agent and legal agent.CBE should engage Nedbank on controls, the bank has to put in place to monitor relationships of their employees and/or agents in instances where the bank instituted legal action against its customers to recover monies loan to parties in respect of properties”, reads the report in part.

Story: By Bongiwe Dlamini
MBABANE:Mlungisi Khumalo, the lawyer representing 8bet has reached out to this publication to clarify that, Miss Trusty Dlamini was not defrauded by the betting company.In a letter to the editor published on Sunday morning, Dlamini alleged that,her money disappeared from her mobile money account adding that, she was not sure whether it was MTN or 8bet.“I’m not quite sure if it’s MTN or 8bet, what happened is; yesterday I had R670.00 in my Mobile Money account and R184.00 184 in my 8bet account.When I woke up this morning I tried to withdraw from my Mobile Money account,I realized that I was left with only R7.00 and when I called MTN they told me the money was deposited into my 8bet account at around 1am and 2am.Then I asked them by who because I was asleep that time and I stay with minor kids(6 and 3years-old).But after receiving information from MTN that the money was deposited to 8bet,I then enquired from 8bet to find out what happened only to find that even the money I had on 8bet had disappeared,only R1.95 was left in my account”, she said.But lawyer Mlungisi Khumalo who has been instructed by 8bet to respond to this publication and work on the matter, vigorously denied the allegations.“As you can see on the excel document every movement of her was recorded and you can clearly see that she deposited herself and as well played with the funds on her 8Bet account.Client instructs that, Trusty has been engaged in over 200 movements since 14th of February and was playing on a regular basis without any problems so far.Our client states that they are in contact with her since yesterday morning and was investigating her complaint, only to find out that nothing was wrong with her movements.Our client was not aware that she wasn’t using her phone, that’s out of client’s control. Miss Trusty Dlamini told client that she was sleeping when the transactions happened so clearly someone used her phone, which is out of our control”, said the lawyer in a letter addressed to the editor.The lawyer further mentioned that his client(8bet)can’t trace who was using Dlamini’s phone adding that, it was definitely not his client that took the money or didn’t pay her.“Especially because, in the past when playing with 8Bet she always received her withdrawals accurately.Our client has proof that on the night of the transaction, where you can see exactly what the excel document states.The full state of the transaction is on the Excel and its there for everyone to see.Our client reached out to Miss Trusty Dlamini and made it clear that we are not at fault. Further,client buttressed the fact that it was wrong of Miss Dlamini to go to the media and blaming 8Bet for something that is out of their control.More importantly, client made it clear that she does not have her momo pin that enabled the money to be withdrawn in her account. And her response was that our client’s explanation made sense and she’s going to take the matter up with MTN”, said the lawyer from Khumalo Attorneys.

This ensures that BE is well-poised to stand as the epitome for integrity and dependability in a manner that creates value for its constituents and the nation at large.The ILO has flown in to capacitate the Business Eswatini Board on the ILO conventions and governance principles in order to deepen the board’s knowledge on the new standards of the world of work, especially against the backdrop of the 4th Industrial Revolution which is accelerating structural changes in labour practices in the workplace. Another aspect to be covered by the exercise is that of the board’s capacity to play its function of oversight on the activities of the secretariat and that of the board’s understanding of the environment in which the secretariat operates at a much deeper level”,reads the Business Eswatini online report.Addressing the induction,Mvuselelo Fakudze,acknowledged the viable partnership that the organization have enjoyed with the International Labour Organization(ILO) for many years.

He thanked them for all the support they had provided on the capacitation of the board and for the technical expertise they have extended to BE in other areas. He said, this ensures that the advocacy mandate placed upon BE is supported by well distilled expertise and is consistent with the best interests of employers and those of the country in general.Leading the delegation of the ILO is Ms. Maria Machailo-Molebatsi who is the Senior Specialist Employer Activities. She expressed delight in the collaboration that the ILO have with Business Eswatini and, by extension, the whole business community of the country. “Our relationship with Business Eswatini dates years back and as the ILO it pleases us that the viable collaboration has not only been growing but has also been yielding exponential benefits for the constituencies we serve. Upholding the highest ethical standards and observing best practices in the areas of corporate governance is crucial for Business Eswatini as the mouthpiece for the business community in the country. We are pleased with the manner in which BE has complied with their corporate governance over the years and as a result, we have offered to support the incoming board of directors to ensure that they are able to keep up with the unimpeachable track record that BE has” she said.

MPAKENI:Jeremy Liang, the Ambassador of the Republic of China on Taiwan allegedly unleashed a battalion of armed State police officers to arrest Chinese nationals working at the R3.5billion Mpakeni Dam on Wednesday afternoon,the Chinese citizens were accused of being illegal immigrants and/or working without permits.This comes amid tension between Taiwan and China, as the People’s Republic of China(PRC) intensifies moves to establish diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of eSwatini in line with the United Nations(UN) Resolution 2758 of 1971.The tender to construct the Mpakeni Dam was awarded to a Chinese company, a decision that allegedly angered the Taiwan Ambassador who commands influence within Cabinet and the security forces through donations.It is alleged that,through his Intelligence Unit based at the Embassy in Mbabane,Taiwan Ambassador Jeremy Liang has been screening the Chinese workers and investigating the circumstances surrounding the tender.Samson Sithole,the Chief Executive Officer(CEO)of the Eswatini Water Agricultural and Development Enterprise(ESWADE) is also alleged to be a subject of an investigation by the Taiwan Embassy.ESWADE is the overseer of the Mpakeni Dam project and according to insiders,the CEO “is suspected by the Taiwan Embassy to have played a role in increasing the activities of the Chinese in eSwatini through the R3.5billion Dam project.Reached for comments by this Swaziland News earlier,Jeremy Liang, the Ambassador of the Republic of China on Taiwan said, he was not comfortable to discuss this matter and/or the controversy surrounding the decision to award the tender to the company owned by the Mainland China,he referred comments to Government.“I think you have to contact the eSwatini Government about this,I am not comfortable to speak about it,”said the Taiwanese Ambassador to eSwatini when speaking to this publication.Subsequent efforts to seek further comments from the Ambassador on the latest developments proved unsuccessful as he had not responded to a message sent to him on Wednesday evening.A questionnaire was sent to Government Spokesperson Alpheous Nxumalo, however, he had not responded at the time of compiling this report.But videos in our possession show the armed State police officers ‘grabbing’ the Chinese nationals on Wednesday, some of these Chinese work as Supervisors at the Mpakeni Dam.A questionnaire was sent to Senior Superintendent Phindile Vilakati,the Police Spokesperson, however,she had not responded at the time of compiling this report.Reached for comments by this Swaziland News on Wednesday evening,Samson Sithole,the Chief Executive Officer(CEO) of the Eswatini Water and Agricultural Development Enterprise(ESWADE) confirmed that,the police arrived to arrest the Chinese nationals on suspicion that, they had no work permits.“We are yet to receive information tomorrow on what actually happened because we had written supporting letters for their work permits application.But what I gathered is that, their visas to be in the country were still valid and the issue might be that,the work permits were being processed and not yet granted”, said the ESWADE CEO.Responding to this publication on Wednesday evening when asked to share a comment,Brian Sangweni,the National Spokesperson of eSwatini’s main and largest political party,the People’s United Democratic Movement(PUDEMO)said,foreign missions are not expected to be involved in domestic affairs particularly,on issues of alleged illegally immigrants.“The duty of dealing with suspected illegal immigrants in any particular jurisdiction solely lies with the law enforcement agencies of that jurisdiction and under no circumstances should foreign missions meddle with that no matter how powerful they might be.King Mswati’s government law enforcement agencies are setting a wrong precedence by allowing themselves to be tools of foreign missions who want to settle scores with their perceived rivalries.It should be condemned with the highest possible tone.As PUDEMO,we accordingly condemn this rogue act,the dignity of foreign people will be guaranteed under PUDEMO-led government Foreign Policy and at no point we will allow the dignity of anyone to be traded with anything:not with rice or yellow maize.We seek to build a state that will be a site of mass destination for foreigners either for tourism purposes or investments”, said the PUDEMO National Spokesperson.

Story: By Bongiwe Dlamini
MBABANE:INSTACASH, a fastest growing eSwatini Mobile Money operator has unveiled a funeral cover product for customers.The newly introduced ‘INSTACASH Funeral Cover Insurance has been facilitated under Liberty Life, one of eSwatini’s reputable insurance companies.Speaking to this Swaziland News on Saturday, Mandla ‘Cheeks’ Nxumalo, the INSTACASH Managing Dorector said,introducing the insurance product was in line with the country’s financial inclusion strategy, which identifies the four pillars of inclusion as transaction products; savings,loans,and insurance products. “For a monthly premium as low as E15, a customer who signs up for our funeral cover will get a E10,000 cover, making it the most affordable funeral insurance in the country,” said the Managing Director.On another note, the Managing Director stated that, the facility “is exclusively available to INSTACASH customers aged between 18 and 70 years” and is a member-only product.“This is a member-only cover; meaning one cannot cover a third party. However, during the opting-in process, the customer is expected to provide details of their nominated beneficiary. The beneficiary is the one who makes a claim in the unfortunate event of a member’s demise,” he said. To sign up for this funeral cover, which is onboarded by the underwriter as a Group Cover, customers are urged to dial the INSTACASH ussd *365# and select 6 for Insurance, 1 for Liberty, 1 for Opt-in (signup), beneficiary’s details (phone and ID numbers), and authenticate the sign up by entering their unique 4 digit INSTACASH PIN.The customer will then get an approval notification via SMS in less than a week from the signup date. The Managing Director Nxumalo further explained that once approved, the customer will have a choice to pay monthly or make prepayments.“There are four options for paying premiums: one month (E15), three months (E45), six months (E90) and 12 months (E180). Even with a two percent tariff, the service remains the cheapest by far,” he said. The Managing Director said,customers who want to claim must,after joining the Funeral Cover, wait for a period of three(3)months for natural causes,and forty-eight(48)hours for accidental deaths,most similar facilities have a six month waiting period. As this product is exclusive to INSTACASH customers,the Managing Director urged emaSwati who are not yet registered with INSTACASH to register at any INSTACASH agent identifiable by blue umbrellas written INSTACASH (street vendors) or blue stickers written the same (shops). Meanwhile,for clarifications, Nxumalo said customer care is available through a toll free line 365 as well as through WhatsApp line 79365000. INSTACASH has been in the market for slightly over a year, and already offers an array of convenience-centred services that include Send and Receive Money (only within Eswatini for now); Buy Airtime (for any network); Buy Electricity, Sports Betting (MulaSport for now); and Make Payments. The 100 percent Swazi-owned entity joined two players in the mobile money industry: eMali operated by Eswatini Mobile and MoMo operated by MTN Eswatini.

MBABANE:Brian Sabelwesihle Dlamini,the Swazi National High School Headteacher has been accused of refusing to accept reasonable deposits from parents and sending children back home to come back with the full amount.Speaking to this Swaziland News this week, a grandmother to one of the children said,the Headteacher refused to accept six thousand Rands(R6,000.00) deposit a few days before the opening of the schools.“I am unemployed but trying to earn a living while paying school fees for my grandchildren because their parents died. The Headteacher refused to accept R6000 as a deposit, do you know how difficult it is to have R6000 in this country, utsi ufuna wonkhe lo-R9000”, said the grandmother to the Swazi National High child.Another complaint was received from Zandondo High School where the Headteacher is alleged to have expelled children, the children were allegedly told to come back with school fees.Responding to this Swaziland News, Mduduzi Masilela, the Secretary General(SG) of the Eswatini Principals Association(EPA) said, it was not true that Headteachers demand full payment of school fees amid the current financial challenges affecting emaSwati.“I have consulted with some of the Headteachers and one of them clarified that, it’s not true that he demanded the full payment from parents.He said a decision was taken during a meeting with parents that a 50% full deposit will be accepted and some parents wanted to negotiate even the deposit. The information we have suggests that, the Headteacher was previously lenient accepting even monies less than the deposit and the School Committee warned him that he will destroy the school by doing so, parents must pay the deposit in full and then the balance before the end of the year, those parents are owing school fees for last year. Maybe, I can add because I’m also in the field as a Headteacher, we fully understand the financial situation affecting parents and there’s no Headteacher who can demand a full payment, we take deposits”, said the Secretary General of the Eswatini Principals Association(EPA) when speaking to editor Zweli Martin Dlamini.A questionnaire was sent to Bheki Gama, the Principal Secretary(PS) in the Ministry of Education, however, he had not responded at the time of compiling this report.Eswatini has about 70% of the population living below the poverty line,some citizens are working in the textile, construction,forestry and hospitality industry were the salaries are as a low as one thousand five hundred Rands(R1500) per-month, some civil servants are also struggling financially.

Title: “Dissolve that unlawful Master of the High Court Commission of Enquiry, you are the suspect”,Law Society of Swaziland(LSS) tells Chief Justice Bheki Maphalala.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
MBABANE:Charity Simelane,the Secretary General(SG) of the Law Society of Swaziland(LSS) has,on behalf of the  organization for lawyers, written a letter to Chief Justice(CJ) Bheki Maphalala requesting him to dissolve or disband the unlawful Commission of Enquiry into allegations of corruption within the Master of the High Court’s Office.This comes after the CJ usurped powers of Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister Prince Simelane and went on to appoint the Commission of Enquiry while violating provisions of the Commission of Enquiry Act of 1963.A questionnaire was sent to the Chief Justice, however, he had not responded at the time of compiling this report.In a letter dated 22nd January 2024 and copied to Justice Minister Prince Simelane and Attorney General(AG) Sifiso Khumalo,the Law Society further accused the Chief Justice of stopping a Parliamentary investigation into the affairs of the Master’s Office on basis that,he and other Judges were directly implicated in allegations of impropriety,maladministration and abuse of power.“The allegations of impropriety, maladministration and abuse of power in the Master\'s Office involve inter alia lawyers, judges and your office Chief Justice.It is important that the investigation be carried out by other organs of state which are independent, which in any event are the ones with oversight powers,assigned with the responsibility over the Judiciary and Administration of Estates and vested with the power to conduct an investigation or to establish a commission of enquiry”, reads the letter in part.The Law Society then requested the Chief Justice to disband the Commission of Enquiry and allow lawful authorities to appoint an independent Commission to investigate the Office of the Master of the High Court.“Honourable Chief Justice, we request that you reconsider your decision to establish the enquiry, disband the Commission and defer this to the lawful authority. The other organs who are empowered to investigate the irregularities in the Master's Office have shown willingness to set up aninvestigation. Ironically, a Parliamentary investigation into the Master's Office was stopped by an application instituted by the Chief Justice.The Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs is the Minister under whose responsibility the administration of estates falls as per Legal Notice No.189 of 2015,Assignment of Responsibilities.The Minister has the mandate and is empowered by the laws of the country to establish such an enquiry, but your office does not have such mandate and power,” reads the letter in part.

Title: State journalist Mbono Mdluli alleges forced resignation,Observer Managing editor Mbongeni Mbingo says he disappeared after being questioned for underperformance.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
MBABANE:Mbono Mdluli,a journalist of the State owned Eswatini Observer has written a letter to the Media Union reporting Managing editor Mbongeni Mbingo who allegedly forced him to submit a resignation letter.In a letter dated 28th December 2023, where the seasoned journalist reported the editor to the Media Union, Mdluli alleged that Mbingo asked him to produce story ideas knowing very well that, he was from Walter Bennett’s Office to collect some Supreme Court documents and was about to read them before identifying story angles.A story idea or angle in journalism,refers to the types of stories that a journalist intends to pursue,story ideas are submitted by journalists and approved by editors before being actioned.“The bone of contention was the submission of what we call a diary in the afternoon. This is the list of four stories that I had done yesterday. The time was around 16:30 and I was supposed to have handed that by 16:00.However, I could not do that because I had gone to Buzzby Services offices(Mr Walter Bennett’s company’s offices at Dlanubeka Building) to fetch some Supreme Court papers regarding a matter between certain families.I returned from Mr Bennett’s Offices at around 16:25 and I wanted to read the documents to find out what the matter was about.This was when I was called into Mr Mbingo’s office having been informed by Mr Phephisa Khoza that Mr Mbingo was calling me.I went into Mbingo’s office and she was sitting there with Miss Sukati.Mr Mbingo told me to get in with my notebook which I did. He then ordered me to inform him of the stories I had been working on during the day-the diary.I apologized because I had not prepared the diary and I asked him to give me some time to prepare it. He refused saying I should have prepared it by that time”, reads the letter from the journalist to the Media Union.Reached for comments on Monday morning, Mbono Mdluli, the Eswatini Observer journalist confirmed the letter to the Media Union.“I can confirm knowledge of that letter that I wrote to the union”, said the journalist.Efforts to seek a comment from the Media Union proved unsuccessful at the time of compiling this report.But Mbongeni Mbingo,the Managing editor of the Eswatini Observer when responding to this Swaziland News on the subject matter, denied that Mbono Mdluli was forced to resign.But instead, the editor clarified that,he was held accountable for underperforming and writing stories that resulted to the publication being forced to publish retractions.Writing articles or stories that constituently resulted to retractions is regarded as underperforming or dereliction of duties in the media as that places the newspaper at the risk of being sued or losing credibility in the eyes of the readers.“Good morning,I am not aware that Mbono has been forced to resign.To the best of my knowledge, and I am certain you will understand this,Mbono was asked to account for his performance and reminded that he is expected to do his quarter of stories.He was therefore reminded that he is a serial underperformer whose stories have forced us to publish retractions.In this aspect he was asked why should not be disciplined.We have not heard from him since that day.If anything, he would have been expected to submit a written complaint, which I do not have.To the best of my knowledge, Mbono has absented himself from work for two weeks”, said the Eswatini Observer Managing editor.

Title: Ngudzeni R500,000.00 Government-donor funded Water Project creates conflict among residents,MP Charles Ndlovu intervenes as Chairman accused of using water for dagga farming.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
NGUDZENI:Charles Ndlovu,the Ngudzeni Member of Parliament(MP) had to intervene and dissolve a Community Water Scheme Committee led by Chairman Mathole Nxumalo after residents complained that,they were no longer benefiting as Nxumalo was using the water for dagga farming.It has been disclosed that, the project was facilitated by the eSwatini Government in collaboration with international donors from Japan.Reached for comments on Saturday evening, the Ngudzeni MP confirmed that, as Inkhundla Council they have dissolved the Water Scheme Committee and replaced with it with new members to restore order within the community.“We  have addressed the matter and after inviting Community Development Officers from the Natural Resources and Tinkhundla Ministries, we decided to dissolve the Water Scheme Committee and replaced it with new members”, said the MP when speaking to this Swaziland News.Responding to this publication on Sunday morning, Mathole Nxumalo,the dismissed Chairman of the Water Scheme Project denied that, he was using the water for dagga farming.He alleged that, some community members were refusing to pay for the water yet the project requires maintenance including electricity units,hence the need for the beneficiaries to pay.“Actually some residents were refusing to pay for the water, they wanted to benefit for free such that they even asked those who were campaigning to go to Parliament, to buy the electricity units for them.It’s not true that I was using the community water for dagga farming.Kuyenteka nje ube nengadze bese ukhandza kutsi engadzeni uhlanyela lokwa-nalokwa,lokutsi sente ema-vegie ngoba kute li-plate leliba nemphilo nakute anyanisi, green paper, naloko lokuhlata spinach. Kuyaye kulinywe loko nje bese-ke labafuna kukukhuluma kabi, sebatsi ulima ini-ini bentela kukona nje ngoba phela sisahamba bantfu abafuni kukubona ususa lunyawo”, said the dismissed Chairman of the Water Scheme.Nxumalo further told this publication that, the project was established and funded by donors from Japan and residents were then expected to maintain it by contributing monthly for the water,however he said, some wanted the natural resource for free.Reached for comments on Sunday, Nokwane Mamba,the Ngezane community Governor(Indvuna) under Ngundzeni Inkhundla confirmed that, a conflict erupted among residents over the water project.“After being dismissed,the Chairman later refused to surrender water tanks and opted to run to the police to open a case after a heated argument with other community members.As we speak there’s a court case and we are going back to court on the 11th January 2024”, said the Ngezane Indvuna.On another note,the Water Project under dispute is servicing Ngezane-Lomfofo residents.Speaking to this publication Make Thandi Hlanze accused the dismissed Chairman of blocking the water that was benefiting even a school within the area. She alleged that, after winning the recent elections, their MP Charles Ndlovu and the Inkhundla Council organized a community meeting, a few days ago to understand issues affecting them.“After winning the elections our MP and the Inkhundla Council came here to meet us. Watsi MP “nangi-khankansa ngeva tikhalo ngemanti kwentekani?. Umgijimi wakhomba mine emhlanganweni ngoba ngiphindze ngibe kuBandlancane watsi angikhulume.Ngasho-ke kutsi emanti avalwa ngunangu Nxumalo ulima ngawo lensangu yakhe. We struggling here with water yet government provided tanks, some of the tanks were grabbed by Nxumalo for personal use.He then dragged me to court for speaking the truth during the community meeting”,said the resident, a member of the Inner Council(Bandlancane).On another note, Ngudzeni MP Charles Ndlovu when speaking to this publication assured the residents that, the issue will be sorted before the end of January 2024 and water will be available.“We hope to sort out the issues around the borehole before end of January 2024 and be able to provide clean water to all the over 100 homes,” said the MP.On another note,Make Thandi LaHlandze thanked the MP and the Inkhundla Council for coming back to them so early after winning the elections to address their issues.

NHLANGANO:Luke Lushaba,the Chief Fire Officer in the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development has dismissed allegations suggesting that,Bradlows Furnitures Nhlangano suffered loses after the eruption of fire due to shortage of vehicles.This comes after fire erupted at Nhlangano Bradlows in the early hours last week Wednesday,causing damages amounting to over R1million, fire fighters later told this Swaziland News that, they couldn’t control the fire due to shortage of resources as vehicles were providing services during Incwala.“It’s not true Nkhosi that,there were no vehicles.Yes, according to the report I have,the damage was huge but there are many factors that could have contributed to this like failure to urgently report the fire.As the fire department, we respond once we are alerted that there’s fire and that complex is situated next to the Fire Station, we could have quickly responded”, said the Chief Fire Officer when speaking to editor Zweli Martin Dlamini on Friday afternoon.Efforts to reach Ludzidzini Indvuna Themba Ginindza and Bradlows Management proved unsuccessful at the time of compiling this report.Reached for comments,Sivumelwano Nyembe, the Spokesperson of the pro-democracy MultiStakeholder Forum(MSF) said, it was wrong for the Fire Department to allocate all vehicles for Incwala ceremony leaving the citizens and businesses vulnerable.“It’s sounds like poor planning because State activities are known and resources that are needed must be allocated without compromising emergencies”, said the MSF Spokesperson.

Title: No breathalyzers for eSwatini police, Spokesperson Senior Superintendent Phindile Vilakati says they will now arrest drivers who smell alcohol without conducting tests.
Author: By Bongiwe Dlamini
Story: By Bongiwe Dlamini
MBABANE:Senior Superintendent Phindile Vilakati, the eSwatini police Spokesperson says, the law enforcement institution has ran out of breathalyzers to test suspected drunk drivers when staging roadblocks.A breathalyzer is a device used for measuring breath alcohol content on suspected drunk drivers.Speaking to eSwatini TV on Wednesday, the police Spokesperson said, even though they no longer have working equipment, they will just arrest drunk drivers who smell alcohol or who were seen drinking before driving the car.“We don’t have the breathalyzers but that does not mean we cannot arrest a driver who visibly drunk and smells alcohol”, said the Police Spokesperson.Reached for comments by this Swaziland News on Thursday morning,Sivumelwano Nyembe,the Spokesperson of the pro-democracy MultiStakeholders Forum(MSF) said, State agencies must follow the law not short-cuts that might create chaos.“It is important for State agencies to follow the law not shortcuts, if the police are facing shortage of working equipment, they must approach their employer.The lack of equipment and tools for civil service to provide public goods and services( eg. drugs in health, breathalyzer in the police, passports in home affairs) is a clear demonstration of the irrelevance of the Tinkhundla system. There is a need for the people of Swaziland to forge a new political system through a meaningful political dialogue said the MSF Spokesperson.

Title: BUSINESS ESWATINI CEO NATHIE DLAMINI ON FESBC TENSION WITH FOREIGN INVESTORS:Our country needs both local and foreign investors to create jobs, enhance economic growth.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
MBABANE:Nathie Dlamini,the Business Eswatini Chief Executive Officer(CEO) says, the country needs both foreign and domestic investors to create jobs for the people and enhance economic development.Responding to this Swaziland News on Tuesday evening after being asked to share his views regarding the ongoing tension between the Federation of Eswatini  Business Community(FESBC) and investors of foreign origin, the former Eswatini Telecoms Managing Director said, “for this reason at Business Eswatini”, they were vigorously busy pushing for both local and foreign investments projects.“This country desperately needs investors, both local and foreign.It’s the only way this country can create the jobs desperately needed by our people, especially our youth.Empirical data tells us that we need both if we are to make a dent into our burgeoning unemployment numbers.Trust me when I say there's no two ways about this.Which is why we are perennially busy at Business Eswatini vigorously pushing for both local and foreign investment projects for that same reason.That being said, though, one shouldn't be unmindful of the indisputable fact that the combination of both allows for the speedy cross-pollination of much-needed skills and expertise between the two, thereby producing amazing downstream benefits to smaller entities in particular. Ultimately, jobs which could not otherwise have been created, begin to emerge”, he said.The Business Eswatini CEO further mentioned that, “once a company be it foreign or local,” is legally registered, it then acquires the full corporate citizenship of that particular country with rights and obligations of any corporate entity.“This basically means that once a company is planted in our soil, a distinction as to its origins shouldn't necessarily arise, neither should it’s corporate citizenship be undermined by its origins.I say this because in terms of sheer volumes, we have more members under our portfolio which one can classify as 'indigenous'-as it were, only that they tend to be smaller in terms of size and turnover. Then we have big businesses which, as you know, are very few in this country but tend to be a tad bigger in terms of turnover.Business Eswatini, as an apex organisation which is recognized by the ILO is expected to stay true to our founding mandate, if only as part of our obligations within the tripartite structures.We use the same lense to recognize businesses in the country because they all create jobs that we need”, said the Business Eswatini CEO.But Dlamini clarified that, despite using the same lense when recognizing businesses, they always remain morally vigilant and sensitive to the special needs of the smaller businesses that need their help as Business Eswatini in order to grow and expand. “Think of Vukani Bomake Projects, which is a BE-driven initiative which has seen scores of locals being launched into businesses around remote villages around the country with the support of bigger businesses.We are busy empowering emaSwati everyday as part of our moral obligation and national duty; which perhaps explains why we let our work do the talking more”, he said.

Title: FESBC HEAD OF BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION MAVELA SIGWANE:Ex-Army Commander Jeffery Shabalala’s Security Unit to arrest Ashraff,Neal and Shakantu if police delays.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
MBABANE:Mavela Sigwane,the Federation of Eswatini Business Community(FESBC) Head of Business Transformation says,former Army Commander Lieutenant General Jeffery Sipho Shabalala is heading a security unit within the federation that will even arrest capitalists who are allegedly corrupt.Speaking to this Swaziland News on Sunday during an exclusive interview when asked to clarify the role of the former Army Commander within the federation, Sigwane said,the federation of indigenous businesspeople was preparing to conduct a crackdown against foreign businesspeople and those who are allegedly using corrupt means to destroy the economy.Shabalala,the highly expirienced former Head of Intelligence in the army was announced as FESBC’s Head of Safety and Security on Friday during the organization’s end of year presentation by FESBC President Tum ‘Buhlebemajaha’ DuPont.“The former Army Commander is heading the Safety and Security Unit within the federation, we have acquired guns and we are now ready to start working. After collecting evidence, Shabalala’s Safety and Security Unit will visit the corrupt within their homes, arrest and hand them over to the police.We  have heard Government Spokesperson Alpheous Nxumalo saying Government was concerned that we have acquired guns, what about Neal and Montigny who have mercenaries with guns and they even confessed that they have a list of people to be killed?.Inyatsi senior officers are escorted by security officers armed with guns.Is it an issue now that indigenous businesspeople are arming themselves? We can assure those foreign businesspeople who are looting our economy while indigenous businesspeople struggle that,kusetawugijinywa(we will deal with them). Furthermore, we don’t want anyone to touch our members who are dealing with dagga using POCA, that law was not established for dagga farmers but to deal with the people who are involved in illegal dealings to acquire wealth. Dagga farmers are just ordinary farmers who are farming cannabis that is in the process of being legalized”, said the FESBC Head of Business Transformation.Sigwane said, they noted with great concern that SwaziPharm Director Kareem Ashraff and others who were cited in the looting of public funds within the Ministry of Health were still not arrested despite overwhelming evidence implicating them.He further expressed serious concern about Inyatsi boss Michello Shakantu and Montigny Investments Director Neal Rijikernberg who,he said were supposed to be behind bars by this time for alleged commercial crimes.“Our Safety and Security Unit headed by the former Army Commander will also visit people like bo-Shakantu, Ashraff and Neal including those implicated in the drugs shortage scandal,arrest and hand them over to the police. Sitababamba nakukhona lokonakalako kutawulungiswa sibe sisebenta,kusetawuginyinywa”, he said.On another note,Sigwane said FESBC was a global organization with partners around the world, he warn those who might try to use their political power to deregister the federation once it starts the crackdown against foreign businesspeople that, they won’t succeed as the organization was globally networked.“While we deal with the foreign businesspeople this side who are looting our economy, we will work with our global partners and approach the courts within the countries where the money that was stolen here is hidden and freeze their bank accounts.We want the economy to benefit the people including the indigenous businesspeople.It should be noted that, while doing this, we won’t touch our King, we know the King’s weakness in all this but, he is our King we won’t touch him. We want to deal with these foreign capitalists”,said the FESBC Head of Business Transformation.Tension is escalating between foreign and indigenous businesspeople in eSwatini amid concerns suggesting that, companies owned by foreigners are grabbing giant businesses and dominating the economy.Eswatini has about 70% of the population living below the poverty line and situation that is slowly causing tension within the Kingdom,was worsened by amongst others, inequality in the distribution of wealth and public resources.

Title: Qualified eSwatini contract teachers with Degrees paid a mere R4,883.97 amid collapsed education system, Government fails to pay bonus as per contract agreement.
Author: By Bongiwe Dlamini
Story: By Bongiwe Dlamini
MBABANE:Life is literally a struggle for qualified contract teachers with Degrees in the Kingdom of eSwatini, they are paid less than five thousand Rands(R5,000.00) and the State failed to double their payment for the month of December 2023 as per a contract agreement.The amount paid to the contract teachers is equivalent to $257.00 when calculated with the current Rand-US Dollar exchange rate.Efforts to reach Owen Nxumalo,the Minister of Education and Training proved unsuccessful at the time of compiling this report.Reached for comments on Sunday afternoon,Lot Vilakati, the Secretary General(SG) of the Swaziland National Association of Teachers(SNAT) confirmed that, the contract teachers were not paid their ‘thirteen(13th) cheque’ but clarified that, the matter was being addressed.“We are aware of the matter and we contacted Government regarding this and the response was that, there were certain challenges, the payment will be released this week”, said the SNAT Secretary General when responding to editor Zweli Martin Dlamini.On another note, Zweli Martin Dlamini, the editor of this Swaziland News has called upon media colleagues to prioritize the issue of the education system before it’s too late.“Just like the health crisis, the education system has collapsed and we need to prioritize it as the media so that relevant stakeholders can take action.No scholarships for University students, no working equipment for teachers in schools and Lecturers in Universities.Qualified teachers with Degrees are underpaid, this is a crisis and the sooner we realize that this government has failed the better,” said the editor.The editor described the low salaries paid to the qualified contract teachers in eSwatini as an insult to the teaching profession that was once held in high regard and produces all other professions in this world.

Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
MBABANE:Ncobile Magagula,the Eswatini Telecoms Corporate Affairs Manager has been suspended pending an internal investigation into the alleged hacking of a Facebook page belonging to the State owned telecommunications company.It is alleged that Magagula,the daughter of former Labour Minister Winnie Magagula might have played a role in hacking the online systems of the telecoms company hence the suspension.As a result of the alleged hacking,the State owned telecommunications company lost ownership of the Facebook page and the last online update was on or around the 25th October 2023.A questionnaire was sent to Ncobile Magagula,the Eswatini Post and Telecommunications Corporation(EPTC)Corporate Affairs Manager,however,she had not responded at the time of compiling this report.Responding to this Swaziland News on Thursday afternoon when asked to clarify the matter,Themba Khumalo,the Eswatini Post and Telecommunications Corporation(EPTC)Managing Director said,the matter was a subject of an internal investigation hence it wouldn’t be appropriate for him to comment.“It’s a matter that is a subject of an internal investigation and if the findings are adverse,it might result into disciplinary action hence it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment about it,” said the Managing Director.On another note,the suspended Corporate Affairs Manager was once implicated in the disappearance of millions for the Charity Cup.But the Management of the company at the time failed to discipline her due to the influence of her mother who was once appointed as the Minister of Information,Communication and Technology(ICT) before being re-deployed to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.The State owned company has been targeted by cyber criminals who allegedly colluded with senior Managers,in August 2019,the company lost R16million within three(3)days in a well-planned and highly syndicated cyber fraud.

Title: MONTIGNY SPOKESPERSON SIHLE MAVUSO:We never stopped emaSwati businesses from selling timber at Richards Bay,FESBC claims spurious.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
MBABANE:Sihle Mavuso,the Spokesperson of Montigny Investments says,the forestry company never stopped emaSwati’s businesses from selling timber at Richards Bay-South Africa.Responding to this Swaziland News on Monday evening,after businessman Mavela Sigwane of the Federation of Eswatini Business Community(FESBC) reported the forestry company to the Eswatini Competition Commission(ECC)for allegedly blocking indigenous businesspeople from selling timber in South Africa,the Montigny Spokesperson described the claims by FESBC as spurious.“Montigny rejects outright the spurious claims made by FESBC,and welcomes any investigation by the Eswatini Competition Commission.Montigny is proud of 20 years of empowering LiSwati-owned businesses and contractors, paying hundreds of millions of Emalangeni in taxes,and transforming the previously failed Usutu Forest operations into one of the most successful sawmilling operations in Southern Africa-now directly responsible for the employment of almost 10 thousand people.Any LiSwati is free to trade and sell their timber in South Africa, but because of border,logistics and import/export challenges,Montigny has facilitated the sale of hundreds of thousands of tons of community timber, benefitting thousands of informal growers,who would have no other option.One has to wonder how many jobs Sigwane has created,as he can’t even seem to hold down his own employment in the mining and sugar industries,and has been accused of harassing and scamming poor students with empty promises of non-existent jobs.I would have expected better from FESBC,”said the Montigny Spokesperson.

Title: ESWATINI COMPETITION COMMISSION CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RESPONDS:Inyatsi Group Holdings purchasing of various companies not in violation of the Competition Act.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini

MBABANE:Muzi Dlamini,the Chief Executive Officer of the Eswatini Competition Commission(ECC) says, the decision by Inyatsi Group Holdings to purchase other companies is not,in any way,a violation of the Competition Act of 2007 particularly,if the law was followed in the process.Responding to a detailed questionnaire from this Swaziland News on Tuesday morning after being asked to clarify if Inyatsi Group Holdings’ decision to buy other entities was not in violation of the Competition Act, the CEO said, the Commission “is responsible for applying competition” rules to make sure that companies compete fairly with each other.Dlamini further mentioned that,accordingly,the fundamental principle of fair competition “is that companies should compete on their merits and should not benefit from undue advantages” that may prevent other businesses from entering and competing in the marketplace.“The reasons why one company may decide to purchase another vary based on the intended objectives of the purchaser. Taking into consideration that companies do not only grow because of their own efforts, the option is for some companies to purchase others in order to achieve the intended growth.Importantly, the decision taken by a company to purchase another is likely due to the fact that the purchaser is confident about future business prospects.As such, the merger or acquisition of a company by another is not a violation, in itself, as long as the processes defined by the Competition Act 2007 are followed when the purchase takes place.The role of the ESCC is to monitor and control the purchase of one business by another to ensure that those companies who may be subject to a related transaction do not engage in conduct that is in violation of the principles of fair competition as earlier explained,”said the CEO of the Eswatini Competition Commission(ECC).When asked to explain and clarify as to what extent does the law allows companies or Group of Companies entities to expand their business interests,the Competition Commission CEO said, competition encourages businesses to become more efficient,innovative and motivates companies to invest in expanding their operations.He said companies are also encouraged to increase the market share as well as enter into new markets in the process of expanding.“The Competition Act 2007,which established the Eswatini Competition Commission (ESCC) is mandated to provide for the encouragement of competition in the economy by controlling anti-competitive trade practices, mergers and acquisitions, protecting consumer welfare and providing for an institutional mechanism for implementing the objectives of the Act.In simple terms,the ESCC is responsible for creating a level playing field in order to give every business an opportunity to succeed in the marketplace.In fact, competition encourages businesses to become more efficient and innovative and motivates companies to invest in expanding their operations to increase market share as well as enter into new markets.Please note that Section 35 of the Competition Act regulates mergers and acquisitions which is a valid way in which a company may purchase another.In deciding whether to approve such a transaction,the ESCC will take into consideration a number of factors listed in the Competition Act 2007 to ensure that the purchase of one company by another does not result in a substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market,” he said.Inyatsi Group Group Holdings has been reported to the Eswatini Competition Commission for allegedly purchasing various companies that are key to the economic backbone or transformation of the country.But Michello Shakantu,the Inyatsi Group Executive Chairman when responding to this Swaziland News earlier said,the law was followed in the process of purchasing the companies.“We have followed the law and everything is above board,”said the Inyatsi Group Executive Chairman.On another note,Inyatsi Group has instructed lawyers from SV Mdladla and Associates to demand a retraction of letter where Tum DuPont, the owner of Tums WaterWorld Hotel who doubles as the President of the Federation of Eswatini Business Community(FESBC) was reporting Inyatsi to the Competition Commission. Reached for comments on Monday evening,prominent lawyer Sdumo Mdladla confirmed receiving instruction from Inyatsi Group Holding to handle the matter.“We can confirm receiving instructions from Inyatsi to handle the matter,”said the prominent lawyer.Responding to this Swaziland News earlier,FESBC President Tum DuPont alleged that,local businesspeople were now frustrated by Inyatsi’s decision to purchase various companies.“As you have seen in the letter,we are urging the Competition Commission to take action against Inyatsi Group and if this fails,we will go to court to seek interpretation if what Inyatsi is doing is in line with the principles of fair competition.Local businesspeople are frustrated and they always complain to us as FESBC hence we decided to take action,"said the FESBC President.In the letter dated 30th November 2023,the FESBC President mentioned Eswatini Meat Industries, Eswatini Mobile,Nkonyeni Golf Estate, Lidwala Insurance Company,The Clinic Group,Umbuluzi Chicken,Inyatsi Construction,United Holdings and Maloma Colliery Limited(MCL)as some of the companies or entities under Inyatsi Group.When asked to clarify the letter, the CEO of the Eswatini Competition Commission(ECC) confirmed receiving it but declined to divulge the nature of the correspondence as they dealing with the matter.“Unfortunately,we cannot divulge the nature of the correspondence received but can confirm that there are related concerns that have been brought to our attention as the regulator for competition in Eswatini, which we are still considering,” said the CEO.

Title: State alleged spy ex-EFF Swaziland President Ncamiso Ngcamphalala’s Ezulwini Car Wash closed,former DPM Themba Masuku and King’s Interpreter Sihle Dlamini’s monies wasted.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
MBABANE:Ncamiso Ngcamphalala, an alleged State spy and former President of the Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF) Swaziland is now financially broke after the landlord evicted and forced him to close his Car Wash at Ezulwini.Financial challenges for Ngcamphalala started when the Eswatini Water Services Corporation(EWSC) caught him ‘stealing’ water by illegally connecting pipes,the water supply was subsequently closed.He then purchased a water tank and could not afford to pay the water and fill-up as he has been running the business with free water and funding.It has been disclosed that, Ngcamphalala’s Car Wash was established with monies facilitated by former Deputy Prime Minister(DPM) Themba Nhlanganiso Masuku,a building material was allegedly sourced at Build-it Mbabane under King’s Interpreter Sihle Dlamini’s account.While business was booming, Ngcamphalala’s was seen in videos drinking expensive alcohol and insulting political activists,at some point, an effort was made to source money from the Youth Fund to assist Ngcamphalala who was struggling to manage the business and would spend the money on alcohol and young women while neglecting to pay rent and salaries for employees.On Tuesday (05 December 2023) the former EFF President was selling some of his remaining properties including a Water Tank,this was after the land-lord evicted him for failing to pay rent.Information gathered suggests that, Ngcamphalala was engaged to create an online publication and counter the independent media that was seen to be promoting democracy, however,it has been disclosed that, his funders that include Sihle Dlamini and Themba Nhlanganiso Masuku concluded that, he was not effective.The closure of the Car Wash comes at the time when efforts were being made to award Ngcamphalala a contract worth one hundred thousand Rands(R100,000.00) through an entity linked to the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Trade, sources close to the matter told this publication that, he was told to register the company.“We will update you if they eventually grant him the job worth R100,000.00”, said the insider.Reached for comments on Wednesday afternoon,the former EFF President said,it was not true that his Ezulwini Car Wash has been closed.“Who told you this information,it’s not true, as we speak, we are here operating,” he said.Both former Deputy Prime Minister Themba Nhlanganiso Masuku and King’s Interpreter Sihle Dlamini had not responded at the time of compiling this report.On another note, it has been disclosed that, the Car Wash has been non-operational for almost a month now, the Eswatini Water Services Corporation(EWSC) who allegedly assisted Ngcamphalala to illegally connect the water was given a warning and ordered by his superiors to disconnect the pipes with immediate effect.Even though Ngcamphalala claimed that, the Car Wash was functional,this publication managed to take fresh pictures on Tuesday afternoon,a Water Tank was purchased on that day.It remains unclear if the State will fund Ngcamphalala, the alleged spy to start another business.

MATSAPHA: Proffessor Justice Tfwala, the University of Eswatini(UNESWA) Vice Chancellor has written a memorandum informing students about the lifting of a ban on student body meetings.“In recognition of the relative calm, stability and improved security of both students and staff that has returned in all three Campuses of the University, the office of the Vice Chancellor has taken a decision to rescind the memorandum it issued on students on 19 May 2023.Accordingly, the ban of student body meetings is lifted forthwith, and student activities including the election of the Student Representative Council can resume.We encourage students to ensure that disruption of normal operations of the University, which have a deleterious effect on all stakeholders, are consigned to the past," reads the memorandum.Reached for comments, the Registrar of the higher learning institution Dr. Selebona Simelane confirmed the authenticity of the communique of the VC."Good morning, yes the communication is authentic,”’said the UNESWA Registrar.Responding to a questionnaire from this Swaziland News on the subject matter, the Swaziland National Union of Students(SNUS) Secretary General(SG) Almighty Msime said, the lifting of the ban on student body meetings was long overdue.“This was long overdue and there's nothing to cherish because the students had been deprived their rights since the beginning of Tinkhundla reign and the only thing we can cherish is the total emancipation of this country so that such scenario cannot happen," said the Student Union Secretary General.The Vice Chancellor of UNESWA banned protests and student meetings within the University on the 19th May 2023 after students from Luyengo, Mbabane and Kwaluseni Campuses respectively, resolved to boycott classes over King Mswati's Government's failure to grant all admitted students scholarships.

Title: PUDEMO calls upon Exams Council to take full responsibility for leaked exam papers,says parents must not be forced to pay extra fees.
Author: By Bongiwe Dlamini
Story: By Bongiwe Dlamini
MBABANE: Penuel Malinga, the Secretary General of the People’s United Democratic Movement(PUDEMO) has urged the Examination Council of Eswatini(ECESWA) to take full responsibility of the leaked Form V exams papers and ensure that parents are not forced to pay extra fees.In a public statement sent to this Swaziland News on Friday, the political organization said, it has been following with keen interest the developments at the Examination Council of Eswatini (ECESWA) regarding the form 5 leaked examination papers and the subsequent decision ordering the learners to rewrite them. “We first note the negligence in handling the papers with confidentiality within the production, storage and distribution chain of ECESWA and we suspect that this might be born of the corruption which characterise Tinkhundla and its entities. The consequence of this negligence does not only affect the credibility of the institution but also the process of the examination and the qualification that is sought to be obtained. To this end, we are calling upon ECESWA to be genuine on her alleged investigation, speed up the process and hold accountable all those who have a hand to the leakage of the papers. We also send a strong call that all the stages of the process must be transparent and no individuals should be protected for such malpractice.On the decision to rewrite, we note that the costs associated with the rewriting the papers are many to both schools and parents,”‘reads the statement in part.The political organization further noted that, as a result of the leaked exam papers, parents are expected to yet again pay transport fees, lunch and other related cost for their children to resit the examination and schools on the other are expected to recommit resources. “This has dire effects to both schools and family budgets. We hold a strong view that the decision that was taken was not a product of thorough stakeholder consultation and it greatly lacks the feeling and interests of parents and learners. We are calling upon ECESWA to consider the following:To take responsibility of the rewriting costs to schools inclusive of paying for invigilators, boarding facilities where applicable and other associated logistics;To assume full responsibility of the negligence and do not charge examination fees to learners for all the papers.To give learners enough time to prepare for the exam before it commences and in between papers.PUDEMO takes this time to remind ECESWA that as an entity that works with stakeholders who have interests in the operations of the entity and who are capable of thinking and providing solutions when there are challenges, it ought to consult them when taking decisions that will affect them. We are also calling upon all parents and learners to follow closely the said investigation process conducted by ECESWA and ensure that a malpractice of such magnitude and costs does not go unpunished,” reads the statement released by PUDEMO.

KA-LUHLEKO:Nozipho Shabangu, the former Miss Swaziland was almost killed by her husband Mancoba ‘Tsotsi’ Ndlangamandla of MP Ndlangamandla Attorneys in Manzini.Videos leaked to this Swaziland News by the former Miss Swaziland’s friends expose the alleged abusive lawyer and her mother Lomgcibelo Mabuza verbal abusing the wife.The incident occurred at ka-Luhleko and Shabangu was first assaulted and almost killed by the lawyer.In another video,Ndlangamandla and his mother are seen abusing Shabangu while another identified person is suggesting that, they must calm down and wait for the police.The lawyer is alleged to have then abandoned the home and ordered the former Miss Swaziland to vacate with immediate effect.“I won’t vacate this is my home, you can go, vele ngeSiswati indvodza itsatsa lijazi ihambe”, said the former Miss Swaziland in one of the videos as the argument reaches the boiling point.The videos cannot be released as they form part of evidence for a pending matter in court.Reached for comments, Nozipho Shabangu, the former Miss Swaziland referred comments to her lawyer Thabiso Fakudze.“Good day Nkhosi, thank you for the call, all matters are in court so I think it’s best you speak to the my lawyer,” said the former Miss Swaziland.When asked to respond regarding the allegations, lawyer Mancoba Ndlangamandla,the husband to the former Miss Swaziland said, he will send a report to this journalist from the Social Welfare so that, this publication can understand “what kind of a person Shabangu is”. He said the report will assist this publication to produce a balanced story.“I'll assist u get a balanced story, ngikuphe nepoti ngaye yaSocial welfare for your perusal, then you'll get to know and understand her ngingakakhulumi lutfo nangaye,all in good time,” said the lawyer in a message sent to this Swaziland News.But when asked to share the report of the Social Welfare, the lawyer changed tune.No Zweli, I'm not about her character parade/assassination,all im saying is all you have is not the truth”, he said when justifying why he won’t send the report.Efforts to reach Lomgcibelo Mabuza, the mother-in law(Maketala) to the former Miss Swaziland who also appeared in the videos siding with son while abusing Nozipho Shabangu, proved unsuccessful at the time of compiling this report.Eswatini is facing a surge in domestic violence cases while the Government demonstrates reluctance to declare Gender Based Violence(GBV) as a national disaster.Reached for comments earlier by this Swaziland News,Nonhlanhla Dlamini, the Executive Director of the Eswatini Action Group Against Abuse(SWAGAA) said,the escalating cases in domestic violence cases “is a clear indication” that Gender Based Violence(GBV) must be declared a national disaster.“We hope the new Prime Minister will declare GBV as a disaster because he understands disasters”,said the SWAGAA Director.

MBABANE: Kenneth Nkambule, an agent of Eswatini Royal Insurance(ERI) says he is financially struggling as Select Management Services continues to grab everything from his salary.Speaking to this Swaziland News on Sunday, Nkambule said, he was servicing a loan with Select amounting to One Hundred Thousand Rands(R100,000.00) and the Money-lending company “is now grabbing money from his salary” far above the agreed amount in installments.“I'm now struggling financially and my kids are suffering”, said the Eswatini Royal Insurance agent.Efforts to reach Select Management Services proved unsuccessful at the time of compiling this report.But in an email seen by this Swaziland News addressed to Nkambule,the Money-Lending Company promised to refund the Royal Insurance Agent part of his deducted monies,the deductions appeared to be an error on the company’s side.This comes after Nkambule wrote to the Head Office,requesting the financial institution to refund him his deducted monies without an agreement."Please note that we have sent your request to Head Office and also because your account was handed over to Legal there is clarity that was requested from our Attorneys before any decision can be made, therefore a response to yourself could be delayed until Monday,”reads the email in part sent to Nkambule by Zandile Makhubu, the Select Management Services Collections Manager.

Title: Judge Justice Mavuso orders eKutsimuleni uMphakatsi’s Indvuna to stop persecuting dead man Richard Sangweni,deceased buried peacefully after judgement.

Story: By Colani Khulekani Maseko.
EKUTSIMULENI: High Court Judge Justice Mavuso’s judgement saw the late Richard Velaphi Sangweni buried peacefully within the premises of his home at eKutsimuleni on Saturday morning.This comes after the Judge visited the area to inspect a burial site, the late Sangweni was being persecuted by eKutsimuleni Indvuna and former Tinkhundla Minister Rogers Mamba who ordered that, he must not be buried within the premises of his home next to his wife but at the Lutfotja Mountain. Mamba subsequently unleashed a battalion of armed police officers from the Operational Support Service Unit(OSSU), to stop the funeral and the family later ran to court for a court order restraining the Indvuna from stopping the funeral.A questionnaire was sent to eKutsimuleni Indvuna Rogers Mamba, however, he had not responded at the time of compiling this report.Reached for comments, Khulekani Shongwe, a resident of eKutsimuleni who was part of the funeral confirmed that, the funeral went well.“The family on Saturday morning finally had a dignified funeral. This time Rogers and his corrupt crew failed to stop the funeral because of a court ruling that was issued by Judge Justice Mavuso, which allowed the family to bury their father within the premises of his home, next to his late wife," said the eKutsimuleni resident.

Title: CYBER CRIME: Zimbabwean alleged scammers pay R2758.56 on Swaziland News bank account for questionable promotional article, editor refuses to publish,reverses money.
Author: By Colani Khulekani Maseko.
Story: By Colani Khulekani Maseko.
MBABANE: Zimbabwean alleged scammers paid Two thousand, seven hundred and fifty-eight Rands, fifty-six cents(R2758.56) to Swaziland News bank account for a suspicious promotional article.The scammers first contacted Zipho Ngubeni, the South African Swaziland News Director and asked for the contacts details of editor Zweli Martin Dlamini.“They asked to pay for a promotional(advertising)article and that link must be active on the website. I started to be suspicious after the lady spoke about online trading, she said some of their clients do online trading and they wanted to create a relationship with Swaziland News, they will pay about Three thousand Rands (R3000) per promotional article. While we were talking, they asked for banking details and I gave them but stated that, I will investigate first if they are credible before publishing their advertorial. The lady claimed to be working for ZimDay, a Zimbabwean publication but the money came from the United Kingdom. Considering the fact that they claimed to be working with giant companies, there’s no way the payment could be processed from a personal account. The links in the article were also suspicious even though some, were seeking to direct the readers to genuine companies.They use legitimate names of employees from reputable companies so that when you call to verify(for example;) the person will call himself Colani Maseko from Swaziland News so that when you call Swaziland News and verify if they know Colani, they will tell you, “Yes Colani is working here” and then you will be deceived”, said the editor.The editor further said, the decision to reject the offer and reverse the money was meant to protect readers from being scammed.“Once we publish this promotional article, our readers globally will be scammed by clicking on the links provided in the advertorial, they will believe that the advertised products are legitimate considering the fact that, they were advertised in a reputable online publication, that’s why the scammers were trying to have the advertising article published here. Maybe we can warn readers to be vigilant of such even on other platforms”, said the editor.

MBABANE: Sifiso Ndzabandzaba of Sitsatsaweni alleges that, lawyer Sipho Anthony Madzinane made him to sign a document accepting two-hundred thousand Rands(R200,000.00) of our court settlement offer and subsequently disappeared without paying him any cent.Speaking to this Swaziland News this week, Ndzabandzaba said, he engaged the services of the lawyer after being involved in a tractor accident and was subsequently admitted in a South African hospital for treatment.“The South African hospital committed a blunder while treating me and I ended-up struggling to walk.I hired the lawyer and the hospital made an offer and that was around 2013. The lawyer made me to sign a document accepting  R200,000.00 as an out of court settlement but he later disappeared and refused to pick-up my calls,” he said.Ndzabandzaba alleged that he reported the matter to the Law Society of Swaziland(LSS) but again, he struggled to receive assistance.Reached for comments on Thursday afternoon, lawyer Anthony Sipho Madzinane confirmed knowledge of the matter but said, Ndzabandzaba rushed to report him to the Law Society and therefore, he decided to drop the matter as the client was no longer having trust on him.“I am aware of the matter, the hospital made an offer and I think that’s the document he is talking about. While working on the matter, I was also communicating with South African lawyers but Ndzabandzaba rushed to report me to the Law Society and I ended-up dropping the matter because it seems he was no longer trusting me.Now that, he has approached you, I am not sure if he wants me to continue with the matter”, said the lawyer.Efforts are being made by this Swaziland News to contact the South African hospitals, to ascertain if the lawyer eventually received the money on behalf of Ndzabandzaba or not.But lawyer  Madzinane urged this journalist to asked Ndzabandzaba if he wants him to continue working on the matter or not.Charity Simelane, the Secretary General(SG) of the Law Society of Swaziland(LSS) told this publication that,she will have to check the status of the matter.“I will check the details of the matter, we had a backlog of cases after the delay in appointing the Chairperson.Now we have Zweli Jele as the Chairperson and we working on such cases, I will check and come back to you”, said the Secretary General of the Law Society.

MATSAPHA: Phindile Dlamini, the Correctional Services Commissioner General allegedly issued an order to over one hundred(100) recruits, to assault incarcerated pro-democracy Member of Parliament(MP) Mduduzi Bacede Mabuza.The Commissioner General went on to deny the MP the right to eat for two(2) days, after blocking his family on Friday.It has been disclosed that, family members were only allowed to see the incarcerated MP earlier on Saturday after this Swaziland News exposed that Mabuza was assaulted inside prison.Information gathered by this publication suggests that, the warders first provoked the MP by blocking his wife and a relative from delivering his food, that was on Friday morning.The warders allegedly lied to the family member who was at the Matsapha Prison gate that, Mabuza said he doesn’t want to see his wife anymore, yet the MP was patiently waiting for his food inside prison.The warders then told the MP to go back to his prison cell as the waiting time for the food was over, the MP allegedly responded by saying he won’t go back to the cell without his food.Over one hundred(100) recruits including drunkards, who drink alcohol at Matsapha Prison Bar were then unleashed by the senior Correctional Officers to assault the MP.It has been disclosed that, in the process, the recruits and drunkards were allegedly shouting “You will know King Mswati today, the country is facing political instability because of you. Utawuyati iNkhosi Mswati namuhla, lelive linjena nje nguwe lowacala lentfo”.A questionnaire was sent to Superintendent Gugulethu Dlamini, the Correctional Services Spokesperson, however, he had not responded at the time of compiling this report.Reached for comments by this Swaziland News on Saturday, lawyer Sicelo Mngomezulu, the lawyer representing the incarcerated MPs confirmed the assault adding that, the family and lawyers were then blocked from seeing the MP hence his condition after the assault, remain unknown.“It’s true, we can confirm that the MP was assaulted and his family was then blocked from delivering food, lawyers are also not allowed to see him. As a result, his condition remain unknown and we are preparing to file an urgent application, seeking an order to be allowed to see him,” said the lawyer.MPs Bacede Mabuza and Mthandeni Dube were arrested as per an order allegedly issued by King Mswati merely for demanding democracy inside Parliament.On another note, the incarcerated MP is currently being kept inside the maximum prison with serious injuries, he was also assaulted all over the body including in the private parts and the eyes. Political activists including human rights defenders are killed by Mswati’s forces inside prison cells, the State normally cover-up the human rights violations by pretending to be establishing a “Commission of Inquiry” with predictable findings and recommendations.

Title: Nhlangano Mayor Mashumi Shongwe sends ‘hot’ message to editor, urges him to stop labeling him as a murder suspect.

Story: By Bongiwe Dlamini
MBABANE: Mashumi Shongwe, the Nhlangano Mayor who stands accused of killing his wife Tigezile Magongo-Shongwe is seemingly tired of being labelled a ‘murder suspect’ in articles published by this Swaziland News.As a results, Shongwe who recently lost elections sent a ‘hot’ message to editor Zweli Martin Dlamini on Sunday afternoon complaining about the continued publication of articles where “he is consistently” labelled a murder suspect.“Zweli unjani,why do u keep labelling me a murder suspect, what are you intending to achieve nje. Don't you know of many good things l ever did in many ways in my life and organizations?. Your bad intentions won't do good of you. At least l less care about what ever you write about me instead you show to be so much against me.You need God in your life so that you can respect other people Zweli,” reads part of the messages sent by the Nhlangano Mayor to the Managing editor.The Mayor further reminded the editor that he was actually the one who was rejoicing each time an innocent soul was murdered, he urged Dlamini to find comfort in God so that he can respect other people in society.On another note, editor Zweli Martin Dlamini urged the Mayor to file a formal complaint and state reasons why this publication must not refer to him as a murder suspect, after killing his wife.“The Mayor is free to file a complaint with the editor and state reasons why this publication must not refer to him as a murder suspect. As the media, we have the responsibility to balance the public interest and individual’s right to human dignity. Alternately, Shongwe can file a complaint with the Press Council of South Africa, an institution that regulates the media including this publication, we will discuss the matter and respect the ruling if we are found to be on the wrong side to refer to him as a murder suspect”, said the editor.The editor further clarified that, the phrase “murder suspect”, suggests that Shongwe is innocent until proven guilty.“Once the court finds him guilty, we will then refer to him as a murderer, for now he is just a suspect who is out on bail and I don’t understand why he is sensitive to be labelled as such by the media. This is in line with journalism ethics and if he wants to confirm that, he must report this Publication to the Press Council”, said the editor.

Title: REVEALED:Newly promoted police officers to share over R5million monthly salaries from public coffers, wage bill to reach R1billion.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
MBABANE: William Tsintsibala Dlamini, the National Commissioner of Police has announced new promotions of one hundred and twenty-three(123) police officers, a decision that will cost taxpayers more than R5million monthly in salaries and the decision is expected to increase the public servants wage bill to R1billion per-month.Eswatini wage bill was previously criticized by the International Monetary Fund(IMF) in a report, on the basis that, the country’s expenditure was far above the Gross Domestic Products(GDP), when compared to other countries on the same development level with the Kingdom of eSwatini.The promoted officers whose names were revealed through a memo this week,include those who were holding the rank of Constables, they will earn about fourteen thousand Rands(R14,000.00) after being promoted to the position of Sergeant.Other officers who were promoted from Sergeant to the Inspector, will now earn about twenty thousand Rands(R20,000.00) in salaries sourced from public coffers.But the issue of salaries and promotions divided the police organization during the political unrest,some officers who previously protested demanding a salary increment were suspended.The new salaries for the promoted police officers suggest that, taxpayers will lose about R5million per-month to members of the law enforcement agency, whose primary duty “is to protect King Mswati an absolute Monarch and the current government”.When asked by this Swaziland News if they “are happy with the new promotions”, Sergeant Dumsile Khumalo, the Secretary General (SG) of the Police Staff Association said, they cannot be happy if experienced police officers are ignored while those who recently passed-out are promoted.“We shall never be happy nangabe kunebantfu labadzala lesolo bangakabekwa bese kuyobekwa bo 84”, said the Secretary General of the Police Staff Association.Reached for comments and asked by this Swaziland News to clarify and justify the promotions, National Commissioner of Police William Tsintsibala Dlamini claimed he was struggling to hear the questions from this journalist.“I am struggling to hear you Mlangeni, awvakali,” said the National Commissioner who subsequently terminated the conversation.But in the documented memo seen by this publication, the National Commissioner noted that, the promotions were approved amid budgetary constraints.“Congratulations are in order to all those who have been promoted amid budgetary constraints to support elevations.Presentations are on-ongoing with relevant Government structures where a request for authority to fill the remaining vacant promotional posts has been made in order to strengthen the operational frameworks particularly at supervisory levels within the organization”, reads the memo in part, signed by the National Commissioner.But it appeared that, the memo was written in a manner aimed at creating hope among other officers that, more promotions will be announced.Reached for comments, Lot Vilakati, the Secretary General of the Swaziland National Association of Teachers(SNAT) said, Government refused to promote and further employ teachers permanently citing financial constraints but, money “is now available” for the promotions of police officers.“We understand that,these promotions might be a strategic move to motivate police officers against us as we are preparing for a go-slow to force government to reinstate our dismissed President Mbongwa Dlamini. But despite that, we will continue with our plan to demand justice for our President”, said the SNAT Secretary General.When asked by this publication to analyze objectively, what the new promotions within the police service mean to the country’s wage bill, a highly regarded economist said, there was nothing wrong if the elevations were within the structure of the police organization.“When you run an organization, you create structures and the organization cannot function properly with certain vacant positions.I would make an example; if the promotions are meant to fill-up certain positions that were left vacate by, kodvwa ngubani nangu umngani wakho lovama kubhala ngaye lobekangu-Deputy Commissioner? Mthembu!. If the promotions are filling-up vacant positions left by deceased officers like bo-Mthembu and Mngometulu, then the wage bill won’t increase because that is within the structure of the organization.The wage bill increases only if, the organization creates new posts,” said the economist.

Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
MBABANE: Zinhle Matsebula, the Director of Cerium Scientific allegedly ordered her Management to meet Scendile Dlamini, the Chief Procurement Officer in the Ministry of Health with an alleged intention of using corrupt means to secure a multimillion drugs supply tender from government.This is contained in emails obtained by this Swaziland News investigation unit amid an investigation into the health crisis, part of the emails were cited in an investigative investigative article released by this publication on Thursday.Hundreds of emaSwati have died since the health crisis erupted resulting to shortage of drugs and other working equipment, with suppliers defrauding government.“I would like to inform you about the discussion we had during my meeting with Make Sincedile as we discussed the development of the Procurement plan along with the supply chain, items discussed for what the procurement plan will need include: threshold of buying. Budget.List of items to be procured. Requisition until contract procedure”, reads the email from the Cerium Scientific and/or Lifespan Administrator’s Office addressed to Director Zinhle Matsebula.As a result of the alleged collusion and subsequent to the meeting between businesswoman Zinhle Matsebula’s company and the Chief Procurement Officer, Matsebula through her alternative company, Cerium Scientific, managed to win the largest ever multimillion tender to supply drugs in hospitals, this is contained in Tender No 14 for the 2023/2024 financial year, signed on the 02 August 2023 by the then Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Health Dr Simon Zwane.Cerium Scientific has replaced the recently removed supplier, Swazi Pharm Wholesalers(Pty) Ltd as Government largest supplier of drugs.Responding to this Swaziland News, businesswoman Zinhle Matsebula denied being involved in any irregularities in the tendering process within the Ministry of Health but confirmed that, she knew the Chief Procurement Officer at professional level.“I am a Pharmacist by profession and met and became acquainted with Ms Sincedile Dlamini whilst I was employed at the Eswatini Government (Central Medical Stores).The relationship is collegial and nothing more.I refute in the strongest terms the insinuation that I am involved in malfeasance in the tender processes.I hold several Degrees from reputable Universities which gives me adequate capacity to excel in what I’m doing.If you know exactly what goes into preparation of medical supplies tender, you will have an idea that there is no way an industry expert can be assisted by a Procurement Specialist,” said the businesswoman when responding to this publication on the subject matter.The Cerium Scientific Director alleged that, her company was receiving government tenders for the first time without disclosing that, she was actually dealing with the Ministry of Health with her separate or alternative company Lifespan Pharmacist.Matsebula is among the government suppliers including SwaziPharm who secured tenders through alleged corrupt means and subsequently looted government millions of Rands, resulting to the health crisis

Title: R3.8MILLION SRA TAX EVASION SCANDAL: Wife Princess Nkhonto in separation with troubled Ludzidzini Council member Ncumbi Maziya, King’s man leaves multimillion mansion for a Guest House.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
MBABANE: Ncumbi Maziya, the troubled powerful and politically connected member of the Ludzidzini Council is allegedly in separation with his wife Princess Nkhonto, amid a high level of tax evasion investigation by the Eswatini Revenue Authority(ERA) into alleged fraudulent transactions amounting to over R3.8million.A separate investigation conducted by this Swaziland News uncovered that, the Princess was also linked to All Sorts Enterprises, one of Ncumbi Maziya’s alleged business entities used to defraud the revenue authority.Nkhonto, the daughter of Prince Mkhatjwa was also working for All Sorts Enterprises as a Business Development Manager.It has been disclosed that, after the business started to generate more revenue, Maziya started to date many girlfriends.But close analyses of the documents further suggests that, some of the fraudulent transactions and business deals were concluded while Maziya and the Princess were staying together in a multimillion mansion at Mahlanya (eMbongolweni) next to Sundowners Restaurant and Lodge.Reached for comments on Sunday, Princess Nkhonto said, she was not comfortable to discuss private issues involving her husband and marriage with the media.“I am not comfortable to discuss my marriage or either disclose whether we have  separated or not”, said the Princess.But privileged information in our possession suggests that, after the Princess separated with her husband, she then communicated with her sister Macici Dlamini, a senior warder within the Correctional Services where she complained that she was sexually starved(uyafa yindlala) as Ncumbi was too busy with girlfriends.The privileged electronic communication suggests that, Princess Nkhonto and her sister concluded that, in the midst of the separation, a young man must be identified for kubamba umuti while Ncumbi Maziya was busy, Macici then allegedly identified and introduced a young warder to Maziya’s wife.The name of the warder cannot be revealed for now as efforts were being made to seek a comment from him.Macici Dlamini, the senior Correctional Services officer avoided questions from this publication when asked to clarify the matter.When investigators from this Swaziland News arrived at Ncumbi Maziya’s multimillion home at Mahlanya this week, some of the plant machinery and trucks that were previously parked there, were no where to found.An investigation uncovered that, the troubled Ludzidzini Council member transported some of the heavy equipment that might be attached by the revenue authority to a safe place.Maziya is now spending more time at his Ngwane Park First World Guest House, a subsidiary entity of N-Plus Logistics, First World Material is an also a subject of an intense investigation by the revenue authority.A questionnaire was sent to the Ludzidzini Council member, however, he had not responded at the time of compiling this report.Reached for comments by this Swaziland News earlier, Vusi Dlamini, the Eswatini Revenue Authority(ERS) Director of Communications said, the revenue institution was restricted by the law to discuss this matter with the media except in a court of law.“Unfortunately as the Eswatini Revenue Service(ERS),we do not discuss issues of our clients in the public domain except in a Court of Law. This prohibition is provided in the Legislation we administer as well as ERS Policies.So even in this case this prohibition applies”, said the Communications Director.

Title: ESWADE CEO SAMSON SITHOLE:We temporarily stopped water supply for Siphofaneni-Othandweni residents amid illegally connections.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
SIPHOFANENI: Samson Sithole, the Chief Executive Officer(CEO) of the Eswatini Water and Agricultural Enterprise(ESWADE) says, they temporarily stopped water supply to Othandweni residents at Siphofaneni amid illegal connections.Responding to this Swaziland News on Sunday afternoon after some residents approached this publication demanding answers why ESWADE stopped the water supply, the CEO said, they acted based on recommendations subsequent to deliberations during a community meeting held this weekend.“The ESWADE acknowledges that there was indeed a temporal fault on the water supply system (as with all systems), which was subsequently attended three weeks ago.Regarding the matter at hand, the ESWADE is pleased to announce that the community has been empowered enough to deal with their own internal issues using their legal guiding document, which is their constitution.During a meeting held yesterday, it is the community who advised the ESWADE to pause all water supply until illegal connections and non payments have been dealt with. NB: 55/600 homesteads have paid. As such we are working under the instruction of the community to deal with all illegal connections and defaulting users,” said the CEO.The ESWADE CEO further mentioned that, it was imperative for the community to understand the importance of paying their monthly water tariff, “which by the way is a very small flat rate”. He said, the monies collected were for both operations and maintenance of the system, such as pipe bursts etc. “The ESWADE handed over this water scheme to the community years back, and it is expected that they have the capacity to run/maintain it on their own. However, The ESWADE is currently embarking on installing solar power on all potable water schemes so that communities have very minimal pumping costs.Energy costs affect both large and small enterprises, hence this intervention by the ESWADE because our paramount objective as an organisation is sustainability.Therefore, disconnections for homesteads who have not paid will continue and illegal connections will continue to be dealt with using the arm of the law,” said the CEO.

Title: Ngwenya Glass workers exposed to danger for a mere R2,500 monthly salary, Managing Director Chas Prettejohn says his office open to negotiations.

Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
NGWENYA: Chas Prettejohn, the Managing Director of the Ngwenya Glass says, he is open to negotiations with his employees, if they feel the two-thousand five hundred Rands(R2,500.00) monthly salary is not enough.The Director was responding to questions from this Swaziland News on Friday afternoon, when asked to clarify why he was paying the workers, some who have already worked for close to ten(10) years a mere R2,500.00 monthly salary, despite the fact that, the workers were exposed to danger.“It’s not true that we have employees who have worked close to ten(10) years but earning R2,500.00, that amount is paid to newly employed workers. I don’t understand why the employees reported this to you because my office is open for negotiations”, said the Ngwenya Glass Managing Director.When asked to clarify if the workers were affiliated to a union and, how he engaged with the them, the Ngwenya Glass Managing Director confirmed that, the employees were not unionized adding that, he normally discusses issues of salaries with them, in their individual capacity.“Every-month, I sit down with each employee to discuss issues of salaries, my office is open for engagements”, he said.But, one of the employees told this publication that, the Director normally targets the employee who is leading and organizing the employees to negotiate collectively.“When we try to come together and engage the Management as a collective, they identify the employee who is leading and negotiate with him/her just to disorganize us”, said the employee.The Ngwenya Glass employee further accused the Management of not providing safety shoes thus exposing them to serious danger as they work with glasses.Wander Mkhonza the Secretary General of the Amalgamated Trade Union Congress of Swaziland(ATUSWA) when asked to comment, he told this Swaziland News on Friday afternoon that, the Managing Director was not being honest by suggesting that it’s possible to negotiate with employees in their individual capacity.“That’s why the principle of collective bargaining was adopted globally,to ensure that workers negotiate with employers as a collective. Otherwise, the employer will yield power and intimidate the employee during the negotiations. As a union, we will see what we can do,maybe, we must visit the workers and see how we can assist”, said the ATUSWA Secretary General.Mkhonza described Ngwenya Glass as an internationally recognized company that attracts even tourists who buy the products, he urged the company to ensure that, the employees are well paid and taken care-off according to international labour laws.“We normally see tourists there buying the products manufactured through the glasses, it cannot therefore, be fair for the employees who produce these products to earn ‘peanuts”, said the well-known unionist.

Title: Provident Fund CEO Prince Lonkhonkhela fails to secure contract extension with the King, Board Chairperson Mduduzi Gina confirms commencement of a recruitment process.
Author: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
Story: By Zweli Martin Dlamini
MBABANE: Prince Lonkhonkhela's efforts to convince King Mswati to influence the extension of his contract of employment as Eswatini National Provident Fund(ENPF) Chief Executive Officer(CEO) were unsuccessful.As a result, the Prince is highly expected to vacate office in the next five(5) months.The current two(2)-year contract of the CEO who was recently exposed by this publication for allegedly looting funds at Tisuka TakaNgwane where he is the Board Chairman, will expire in January 2024.King Mswati has been maintaining a decision to reject contract renewals requests by public servants who approach him, seeking his influence to extend their term of employment.As result, over ten(10) retired public servants who attempted to approach the King in the last three(3) months for contract renewals, are sitting at home, enjoying retirement with their children and grandchildren.A questionnaire was sent to the Provident Fund CEO, however, he had not responded at the time of compiling this report.Reached for comments by this Swaziland News, King Mswati’s Spokesperson Percy Simelane said, he was not aware that the Prince made efforts to convince the King to influence his contract extension.But Simelane clarified that, the matter must be handled by the relevant authorities in the Government Administration outside the influence of the institution of the Monarchy.“We are not aware that there were efforts to convince the King to influence his contract extension and that they were unsuccessful.What we are alive to is that the Monarch expects the authorities in the Administration of Government and quasi- Government institutions to deal with contract extensions within platforms where they are supposed to be ironed out and not to offices which do not have jurisdiction to handle them”, said the King’s Spokesperson.But royal insiders told this Swaziland News that, Prince Lonkhokhela has been making efforts to secure another contract by attempting to meet the King.Subsequently, Labour Minister Phila Buthelezi was allegedly mandated to ensure the smooth recruitment of a new CEO at the Provident Fund.According to insiders, the King analyzed the political situation and realized that most young people who then rebel against the State, were frustrated with no jobs as retired individuals continue to seek contract renewals.“He made efforts to meet the King with an intention to have his contract renewed again but his efforts were unsuccessful”, said the royal insider.But a Board member within the Provident Fund told this Swaziland News that,  Labour Minister recently told them that a letter must be written to the CEO, informing him that the contract won’t be renewed.The Board member further alleged that the Minister said, the decision was taken by Cabinet.“The recruitment process has began, the Minister told us to write a letter and inform the Prince that his contract won’t be renewed.But when we read the contract, it transpired that there were certain provisions that might complicate the matter. So, we are now relying on the law suggesting that, we must inform the CEO at least one-month before the expiry of the current contract hence, the process is going on smoothly.The recruitment of the new CEO must be completed by September”, said the Board member whose name cannot be revealed for ethical reasons.Efforts to reach the Labour Minister proved unsuccessful at the time of compiling this report.Responding to a questionnaire from this Swaziland News, Mduduzi Gina, the Eswatini National Provident Fund(ENPF) Board Chairperson confirmed that, the contract of the Prince was coming to an end adding that,the recruitment of a new CEO has commenced.“I do confirm that the contract of the current CEO of the Fund is coming to an end at the end of January 2024.The processes for the recruitment of a CEO are already ongoing”, said the Board Chairperson.
