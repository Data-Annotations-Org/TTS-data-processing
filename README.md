Overview
This Python script demonstrates how to process CSV files and manipulate text data using Python. The script reads data from a CSV file, separates the text based on certain conditions, and writes the results to separate text files.

Learning Source
The code was developed based on concepts learned from W3Schools' Python tutorials. W3Schools provided a comprehensive guide on Python programming, covering topics such as file handling, string manipulation, and working with CSV files.

Development Process
Reading CSV Data: The script utilizes the csv module to read data from a CSV file. This module provides functions for reading and writing CSV files in Python.

Processing Text Data: The script iterates through each row of the CSV file, extracting and processing text data based on certain conditions.

Conditional Logic: Conditional statements are used to determine whether the text belongs to a specific category (e.g., Setswana sentences with or without numbers, Sepedi sentences with or without numbers).

Writing to Files: Text data is written to separate text files based on the specified categories.

Usage
To use the script:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Download the Python script and the CSV file containing the data to be processed.
Run the script, providing the path to the CSV file as input.
Credits
W3Schools: For providing comprehensive tutorials on Python programming, which served as the foundation for developing this script.
